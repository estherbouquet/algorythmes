We are looking for someone who can appreciate the work/life balance that our company can deliver for them.\n\nQuote from one employe:\n\"I started working a few months ago, came in with no experience and they welcomed me with opened arms. They are more than willing to teach and accommodate my learning curve. Everyone from the office to the warehouse and the Technicians are all a big family. The guys in the field really get along together, want to see each other succeed and its great to be around that environment. I enjoy working here; it's a real family atmosphere. Also, learning from these Technicians that are such masters or their craft is something to strive for!\"\n~ Steve P\n\nBetter yet, here is what Adam had to share:\nLess than 2 years ago I started with Good Tidings and now I am on my way to becoming a full technician. I'm so excited, I just returned from a week of paid sales and customer service training in California and I'm looking forward to using my new skills! The motivation, training and pay increases come along with every step of the way, and you are most certainly not alone when help is needed because we are a team. All the technicians and office staff are like a second family and everyone is there to help out if the going gets tuff. I couldn't have pictured a better environment to learn and grow in this trade, and for that I am truly grateful. \n~ Adam M.\n\nOK, this next part is ONLY for you Doubting Thomas's out there.\n\nI've been hearing from some applicants lately who took years before reaching out to me. They were thinking the Craig's list ad was too good to be true and likely the work of a recruiter. A positive, straight forward, honest, cutting edge Plumbing, Heating and Air-conditioning company here in NJ? Applicants quickly expressed their relief after speaking with me and wished they'd reached out sooner, instead of wrongly thinking that the ad was the product of some scam. \n\nWorse yet, they might have been thinking I was like the big, unethical, money hungry, state wide, corporate owned, get away with whatever I can, \"Teach and reward my people for lying\", soon to be in the papers and speaking and with the Attorney General for ripping off the elderly, type of company (Can you tell how I feel just yet?).\n\nIn an effort to get ahead of these thoughts, please know that I am a very real family man, a 2nd generation Master Plumber, HVAC businessman and license holder. I built my company from scratch, and i care about my company, its people and my customers, enormously. \n\nI'm honest, ethical, integrity filled and unafraid. The cost of which, in the past, going through peak times with trucks sitting idle and the office turning lots of work away. Why turn all of that work and money away??? Because it was the right thing to do, in light of the lack of quality and character of the available workmen, which was way below what my customers expected and deserved for their hard-earned money. It's hard for most people to believe, but I value my faith and integrity above profits.\n\nFor you sceptics out there, I'm climbing out on a limb here, by sharing a very personal account of faith in the workplace. My goal is to put away any doubt or speculation out of your mind and have you see for yourself, what it's been like NOT to be held captive by money and to do the \"right thing\" in business, no matter what the cost. To God be the glory\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BZZQkxULXAo\n\nHonesty matters\n~ Dave\n29 years of faith filled family service!    ","title":"HVAC Techs NOT getting enough hours?

Those are a joke.\nI mean, if those companies are making so much money, why can't they afford to pay a decent base salary AND commissions?\nWell, it's because no one working for only commission is getting \"rich\". They are barely paying bills, if that.\nAll the top sales pros work at exciting and growing companies that can afford to pay them a high salary because the product they are selling has a strong demand. (and OMG it's so much easier to sell too!)\nAnd these growing companies... many of them are in the software industry.\nDid you know the average car salesperson only makes $30,000 a year, according to Glassdoor?\nWhile a software sales rep brings in $100,800 annually?\nCompletely different! It's like they are two vastly different jobs... but they are both still sales roles!\nBut I mean... if you choose to work in sales, you're choosing to do so because you want to make great money, enjoy the freedom and perks of your job, and have a sense of purpose in communicating with, and winning/helping customers.\n(... ah yes, the perks ... like an office that has a keg on tap, a ping-pong room, or XBOX to use for break. Or maybe you just want the ability to work remote because you're good at what you do, regardless of where you do it?)\nSo why not do it in an industry that pays more? I mean, it takes same amount of time and effort to sell right?\nAnd the crazy thing is, right now... many of our software company partners are telling us they can't find qualified people to hire for their entry level sales roles starting in 2018!\nAnd this leads to exactly why many brand-new AND experienced salespeople are signing up for the preHIRED program.\nIf you are tired of not making enough money in sales, or tired of working at company you don't like -- then this may be just for you... so check this out.\npreHIRED is an online Science-Based Sales℠ training & job placement program to take you From Zero to Your Six-Figure Software Sales Job in 40-hours.\nWe train you on the SOFTWARE industry, and how to get your foot in the door.We train you on all the TOOLS and APPS you'll be using in a software sales role.We train you on SCIENCE-BASED SALES℠ and marketing processes, playbooks, and tactics.\n(ALL IN JUST 40 hours!)\nThen we get YOU HIRED at one of our partner companies.\n... or we show you how to get a software sales job at companies you pick.\nAGAIN...

Boasting approximately 80 restaurants and hospitality venues in performing arts centers, Patina Restaurant Group offers outstanding career opportunities for talented & highly motivated professionals who have an eye for detail and an appreciation for the exceptional quality and level of service they stand for.  \n\t\t\n\t\t\tPatina Restaurant Group is passionately involved with the preservation and promotion of America's great cultural centers.  Our family of restaurants are aligned with unique architectural landmarks and cultural institutions that strive to enrich the American experience through fine arts, dance, music, theatre and performance. PRG operates exciting restaurants in world famous locations: from Lincoln Ristorante at Lincoln Center to the Sea Grill at Rockefeller Center; timeless spaces like the Michelin-starred Patina at Walt Disney Concert Hall, or fresh new collaborations like Morimoto Asia or Chef Street in Macy's Herald Square - our restaurants offer the finest in artisanal culinary inspirations. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTHE OPPORTUNITY:\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAt Lincoln Ristorante, we offer Chef Shea Gallante's interpretation of Italian cuisine in New York at Lincoln Center.

We honor the Italian culinary tradition of making our own fresh pastas, grissini, and focaccia. Desserts, by Richard Capizzi, are beautiful renditions of Italy's classics: light, lush and irresistible. A focus and commitment to freshness and respect for every ingredient is paramount in our daily life.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWhile our location beside Lincoln Center's reflecting pool and Henry Moore sculpture is exquisite, with panoramic views and a grass lawn roof, the heart of our restaurant is the central open kitchen.

Wine Director Aaron von Rock and his team offer 350 wines on the list, constantly evolving and focused on small producers.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOur role in the Lincoln Center community is to provide a gracious fine dining experience that reflects the best of both Italy and New York.
