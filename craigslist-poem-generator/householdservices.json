If you are a hoarder looking to help yourself or a loved one who wants to help a hoarder, then this is a good place to start. Why should you have a house cleaned? What are the consequences of hoarding cleanup? How should you approach a hoarder about cleaning up? Hoarders have certain symptoms like any disorder which just happen to be clear and precise because you can see their home to know that they hoard items of no value. Hoarding is a definition of buying and saving items in excess and in mass. In the hoarders' mind, they may know that they want to throw things out but helping them throw them out is the task. They feel overwhelmed and can't make decisions because when they have something in their hand they want to keep it. If an item has no financial, sentimental or useful value, they don't realize this perception. Thinking about hoarders' opinions and thoughts is important to the well being of the hoarder.\n\nHelping a hoarder you have to try to think like a hoarder. Pick up an item and say \"What value can this item hold?\" It has to hold value in the hoarder's mind, for example an old newspaper that is lying on the floor and has no value. In the hoarders mind, they can never read that paper again or purchase it. What if they want to read it again? The convincing part is to let them know that they can read and obtain better information from the Internet or the local library can provide them with this information and in most cases the same article. These items have no value to the hoarder in reality because they can't be found or they cannot remember where they placed the item. First, the hoarder needs to be open for a cleaning and fresh start from all the materials that have no use to them. Once the house is cleaned, they need to develop a daily routine to keep it clean. and Sometimes having drawers for each type of item and once that drawer gets filled, then something must be emptied to keep the new stuff otherwise the new stuff must be thrown away. This limits the collection of stuff and always offers storage. Other hoarders may need, the one for one rule; every time something is purchased something must be given away. Helping hoarders is learning about hoarding, the further educated the individual the better they can learn about the situation and the reasons behind the hoarding situation.\n\nWhen talking about hoarding to the hoarder or someone for advice, we recommend using compassion and helping the person understand what is causing the unhealthy environment in the home. Don't always think about throwing items away but also think about preventing further items from entering the home or pile.\n\n\n((OTHER SPECIALITY CLEANIN/ORGANIZING))\n\nWe specialize in \"Platinum Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\", \"Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\" and almost any types of Deep Cleanings( You can also order just some of Deep Cleaning and/or just 1 room or the area), in addition to Basic weekly, bi-weekly, monthly maintenance cleanings.\n\nSee below for different packages and services and Platinum Elite Top to Bottom Deep Cleaning check lists, which has \"at least 30 items we clean in each area.\" You can order the entire package or order individual deep cleaning items.

If you are a hoarder looking to help yourself or a loved one who wants to help a hoarder, then this is a good place to start. Why should you have a house cleaned? What are the consequences of hoarding cleanup? How should you approach a hoarder about cleaning up? Hoarders have certain symptoms like any disorder which just happen to be clear and precise because you can see their home to know that they hoard items of no value. Hoarding is a definition of buying and saving items in excess and in mass. In the hoarders' mind, they may know that they want to throw things out but helping them throw them out is the task. They feel overwhelmed and can't make decisions because when they have something in their hand they want to keep it. If an item has no financial, sentimental or useful value, they don't realize this perception. Thinking about hoarders' opinions and thoughts is important to the well being of the hoarder.\n\nHelping a hoarder you have to try to think like a hoarder. Pick up an item and say \"What value can this item hold?\" It has to hold value in the hoarder's mind, for example an old newspaper that is lying on the floor and has no value. In the hoarders mind, they can never read that paper again or purchase it. What if they want to read it again? The convincing part is to let them know that they can read and obtain better information from the Internet or the local library can provide them with this information and in most cases the same article. These items have no value to the hoarder in reality because they can't be found or they cannot remember where they placed the item. First, the hoarder needs to be open for a cleaning and fresh start from all the materials that have no use to them. Once the house is cleaned, they need to develop a daily routine to keep it clean. and Sometimes having drawers for each type of item and once that drawer gets filled, then something must be emptied to keep the new stuff otherwise the new stuff must be thrown away. This limits the collection of stuff and always offers storage. Other hoarders may need, the one for one rule; every time something is purchased something must be given away. Helping hoarders is learning about hoarding, the further educated the individual the better they can learn about the situation and the reasons behind the hoarding situation.\n\nWhen talking about hoarding to the hoarder or someone for advice, we recommend using compassion and helping the person understand what is causing the unhealthy environment in the home. Don't always think about throwing items away but also think about preventing further items from entering the home or pile.\n\n\n((OTHER SPECIALITY CLEANIN/ORGANIZING))\n\nWe specialize in \"Platinum Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\", \"Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\" and almost any types of Deep Cleanings( You can also order just some of Deep Cleaning and/or just 1 room or the area), in addition to Basic weekly, bi-weekly, monthly maintenance cleanings.\n\nSee below for different packages and services and Platinum Elite Top to Bottom Deep Cleaning check lists, which has \"at least 30 items we clean in each area.\" You can order the entire package or order individual deep cleaning items.

Additionally we are licensed by NYC Department of Consumer Affairs as reseller of electronic equipment. What does that mean? It simply means that we are responsible business owners. We will not disappear after finishing a project, like most people/companies do that are not licensed. And just because we are licensed it doesn't mean that our prices are sky high. In fact we keep our prices as low as possible and even offer free equipment. What happens if you use a company or a person that is not licensed and insured? They don't care about their reputation. We value our customers and our reputation is of utmost importance to us. We guarantee our work for 2 years and we guarantee the equipment we install for one year. Your first service call on the equipment we install is absolutely free of charge. \n\nOther Services we offer:\nTV wall/ceiling mounting with exposed or hidden wires.\nRelocating your TV and cable box from one room to another.\nAdding a TV to the cable box.\nExtending cable wiring.\n\nWe welcome General Contractors to contact us to talk about complete wiring of residential houses for burglar alarms, CCTV, networking, Home theater, etc.\n\nNYS Department of State License# 12000316145\nNYC DCA License# 2052007-DCA    ","title":"SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS/CCTV/LOW VOLTAGE WIRING/INTERCOMS/FREE EQUIPMENT","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/hss/d/surveillance-cameras-cctv-low/6590496789.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nReliable, experienced female caregiver with experience working in both care facilities and in the home.

If you are experiencing an emergency, we have a repair technician on standby 24 hours a day to respond to emergencies quickly.\n\nWhen your pressure tank stops supplying adequate water pressure, it can make some chores a nuisance, and other chores impossible.

Carbon monoxide is a dangerous, potentially deadly gas with no odor or color. \n\nBathtub & Shower Repair - Although sturdy and reliable, even the bathtub can experience problems. If your shower head stops working or is simply supplying an inadequate amount of pressure, we can help solve the problem. When your bath or shower stops becoming a relaxing escape from a hard day's work, give us a call and we will help restore your in-home retreat to working order.\n\nDishwasher Installation & Repair - Nobody can deny the convenience of a dishwasher-until it breaks down.

If you are a hoarder looking to help yourself or a loved one who wants to help a hoarder, then this is a good place to start. Why should you have a house cleaned? What are the consequences of hoarding cleanup? How should you approach a hoarder about cleaning up? Hoarders have certain symptoms like any disorder which just happen to be clear and precise because you can see their home to know that they hoard items of no value. Hoarding is a definition of buying and saving items in excess and in mass. In the hoarders' mind, they may know that they want to throw things out but helping them throw them out is the task. They feel overwhelmed and can't make decisions because when they have something in their hand they want to keep it. If an item has no financial, sentimental or useful value, they don't realize this perception. Thinking about hoarders' opinions and thoughts is important to the well being of the hoarder.\n\nHelping a hoarder you have to try to think like a hoarder. Pick up an item and say \"What value can this item hold?\" It has to hold value in the hoarder's mind, for example an old newspaper that is lying on the floor and has no value. In the hoarders mind, they can never read that paper again or purchase it. What if they want to read it again? The convincing part is to let them know that they can read and obtain better information from the Internet or the local library can provide them with this information and in most cases the same article. These items have no value to the hoarder in reality because they can't be found or they cannot remember where they placed the item. First, the hoarder needs to be open for a cleaning and fresh start from all the materials that have no use to them. Once the house is cleaned, they need to develop a daily routine to keep it clean. and Sometimes having drawers for each type of item and once that drawer gets filled, then something must be emptied to keep the new stuff otherwise the new stuff must be thrown away. This limits the collection of stuff and always offers storage. Other hoarders may need, the one for one rule; every time something is purchased something must be given away. Helping hoarders is learning about hoarding, the further educated the individual the better they can learn about the situation and the reasons behind the hoarding situation.\n\nWhen talking about hoarding to the hoarder or someone for advice, we recommend using compassion and helping the person understand what is causing the unhealthy environment in the home. Don't always think about throwing items away but also think about preventing further items from entering the home or pile.\n\n\n((OTHER SPECIALITY CLEANIN/ORGANIZING))\n\nWe specialize in \"Platinum Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\", \"Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\" and almost any types of Deep Cleanings( You can also order just some of Deep Cleaning and/or just 1 room or the area), in addition to Basic weekly, bi-weekly, monthly maintenance cleanings.\n\nSee below for different packages and services and Platinum Elite Top to Bottom Deep Cleaning check lists, which has \"at least 30 items we clean in each area.\" You can order the entire package or order individual deep cleaning items.

They tell themselves it's just a mosquito that somehow survived this winter tundra, or maybe a skin rash from your new wool sweater. while your in denial, its very likely that you have bedbugs.\n\nWhat to do: Stop avoiding it and get an inspection from a Pest Control Technician ASAP. Don't just lift the sheets and expect to see them. They can be in cracks and crevices you haven't thought of, so you'll still need a professional to check, even if you don't see any. Again: The longer you hold off, the more they multiply. I'm repeating myself because I can't emphasize this enough.\n\nHow to cope: Tell yourself that getting the inspection will put your mind to rest if you DON'T have them. If you do have them, tell yourself it's good you caught it sooner rather than later.\n\nBed bugs lay white, oval eggs into cracks and crevices,carpets,couches,beds,baby cribs, etc... An individual bed bug can lay up to 200 to 250 eggs in her lifetime. The eggs hatch in about 6 to 10 days and the newly emerged bed bug nymphs seek you or your children to feast on.\n\nIf you have bed bug issues don't wait, don't hesitate, they reproduce rapidly. \nPlease give us a call, we would like to assist you.

Give me a call and I can help and guide you both through the entire process.  To qualify as a personal assistant, one must be legally allowed to work. No formal or HHA training is required.

I currently work as a Recipe Developer, Culinary Producer, and Cooking Show Host for a large media company that focuses on food, entertainment, and travel.  I also have about 15 years of restaurant experience.  My dream is to write my own cookbook and run my own meal delivery service.  However, I want to offer a more personalized meal plan compared to Blue Apron, Sun Basket, or anything else that's out there in the meal delivery world.  The service I want to offer is somewhere in between a private chef and a delivery program.  I want to work with my clients to figure out exactly what kind of diet and lifestyle they want for themselves (organic, vegan, plant based, paleo, etc) and each week I want to bring custom portions of the food my clients crave right to their door... perfect for weekly meal prep, families, or just grabbing something healthy on the go.  I'm posting this mainly for feedback.  I'd like to see if this is something New Yorkers would want.  Whether you don't have time to cook or you don't like to cook, everyone deserves a healthy, thought out, home cooked meal.  I have so many career driven friends who blindly order takeout and I worked as a nanny for years and experienced so many loving parents who wanted the best nutrition for their children but could never find the time to make it happen.  I want to be the person that provides that service for anyone who wants it... because we all deserve food made with love.  If you think you could benefit from a program like this or you know someone who would... even if you'd just like to give your opinion on my business plan... please drop me a line... What I'm really looking for right now is feedback because this is a business I want to launch down the road.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!

I hold two higher educations as a teacher of Russian language and literature and as a doctor. Since moving to NY with my daughter 9 years ago, I enjoyed working as a babysitter for 2 wonderful Russian-speaking families. \n\nFirst, I cared for a boy from the age of 6 months to 4 1/2 years, then I cared for a girl from the age of 9 months to 5 1/2 years. I paid very close attention to their developmental progress. I educate children by playing games, reading and talking, and taking them for walks. I enjoy helping children develop a good understanding of Russian culture, language, and literature. I take pride in tenderly caring for children's well-being, making sure that they are well-fed, dressed for the weather, etc.\n\nI have warm and trusting relationships with these children's parents. They describe me as intelligent, well-mannered, responsible, reliable, kind, and caring. They are more than happy to answer your questions!\n\nPlease email me at DASHA150@YA.RU to set up a time to talk on the phone! (I don't feel comfortable posting my number on here).
