If you are a hoarder looking to help yourself or a loved one who wants to help a hoarder, then this is a good place to start. Why should you have a house cleaned? What are the consequences of hoarding cleanup? How should you approach a hoarder about cleaning up? Hoarders have certain symptoms like any disorder which just happen to be clear and precise because you can see their home to know that they hoard items of no value. Hoarding is a definition of buying and saving items in excess and in mass. In the hoarders' mind, they may know that they want to throw things out but helping them throw them out is the task. They feel overwhelmed and can't make decisions because when they have something in their hand they want to keep it. If an item has no financial, sentimental or useful value, they don't realize this perception. Thinking about hoarders' opinions and thoughts is important to the well being of the hoarder.\n\nHelping a hoarder you have to try to think like a hoarder. Pick up an item and say \"What value can this item hold?\" It has to hold value in the hoarder's mind, for example an old newspaper that is lying on the floor and has no value. In the hoarders mind, they can never read that paper again or purchase it. What if they want to read it again? The convincing part is to let them know that they can read and obtain better information from the Internet or the local library can provide them with this information and in most cases the same article. These items have no value to the hoarder in reality because they can't be found or they cannot remember where they placed the item. First, the hoarder needs to be open for a cleaning and fresh start from all the materials that have no use to them. Once the house is cleaned, they need to develop a daily routine to keep it clean. and Sometimes having drawers for each type of item and once that drawer gets filled, then something must be emptied to keep the new stuff otherwise the new stuff must be thrown away. This limits the collection of stuff and always offers storage. Other hoarders may need, the one for one rule; every time something is purchased something must be given away. Helping hoarders is learning about hoarding, the further educated the individual the better they can learn about the situation and the reasons behind the hoarding situation.\n\nWhen talking about hoarding to the hoarder or someone for advice, we recommend using compassion and helping the person understand what is causing the unhealthy environment in the home. Don't always think about throwing items away but also think about preventing further items from entering the home or pile.\n\n\n((OTHER SPECIALITY CLEANIN/ORGANIZING))\n\nWe specialize in \"Platinum Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\", \"Elite Top to bottom Deep Cleanings\" and almost any types of Deep Cleanings( You can also order just some of Deep Cleaning and/or just 1 room or the area), in addition to Basic weekly, bi-weekly, monthly maintenance cleanings.\n\nSee below for different packages and services and Platinum Elite Top to Bottom Deep Cleaning check lists, which has \"at least 30 items we clean in each area.\" You can order the entire package or order individual deep cleaning items.

I have been teaching guitar in the New York City area to students of all ages since 2006, both independently and as a faculty member at New York Music and Arts in Queens. \n\nMusic is a language, and I believe that if you can speak, you can learn to play music. When we speak, we use rhythm, cadence and pitch to express ourselves. Also, just like spoken language, music takes some practice to learn. There will be struggles, but with the right attitude and desire to learn, overcoming them can be satisfying and exciting, rather than tedious.\n\nI've had experience with a wide range of students, from those who intuitively grasp rhythm and have so-called \"perfect pitch\" to those who struggle to keep a beat and feel they \"have no musical talent.\" I believe that everyone has the potential to express him or herself musically, and that if the teacher is patient and tries to understand how the student perceives music in order to explain things in a way that will make sense, and also provided that the student has the desire and determination, he or she can learn to play. Yes, even those who believe they \"have no musical talent\"!\n\nI also strongly believe that of the things we learn, the knowledge that \"sticks\" is the knowledge that we gain as a result of our own initiative. I try whenever possible to work on music that the student chooses or expresses an interest in.\n\nCheck out my website for more information, including testimonials, details about lessons, my musical and educational background and more. If you would like to set up a trial lesson or have any other questions, contact me through Craigslist or through my website. \n\nThanks and I look forward to working with you!\n\n-Russell\n\nwww.russellhollandguitar.com\n\n\n---------------\n\n[search terms: guitar lessons tutoring instruction classes music theory beginner intermediate advanced teacher tutor adult adults kids children acoustic electric rock pop blues jazz classical country manhattan brooklyn queens]    ","title":"Guitar Lessons In Your Home - All Ages","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/lss/d/guitar-lessons-in-your-home/6601776481.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nGypsyRose Bee Cleaning & Organizing\n\nCall / Text Monica @ 917.268.3899\nApartment & Residential Cleaning & Organizing\nServing Staten Island & Manhattan\n\nBonded.

I have studied piano for over 16 years, most notably with faculty at the Yale School of Music (weekly lessons and end-of-the-year performances) over the last 4 years.\n\nI am trained in classical theory as well as performance, and have performed in many different venues over the years, including Carnegie Hall as a competition winner. In addition, my musical interests extend outside of classical music; I have significant exposure to music production (pop, hip-hop), and limited experience with jazz. \n\nMy primary strength is in late-romantic, especially Russian repetoire (Scriabin, Rachmaninoff). \n\nAs far as teaching experience, I have taught music to middle-school/high-school students over the last couple years. \n\nI am in New York indefinitely, and I am happy to teach piano lessons to beginner, intermediate, and advanced students. Lastly, I will come to you, as I have no piano studio where I live. Please contact me via e-mail if you are interested!

If you prefer certain venues, I'm happy to access that for you. Tenants typically pay fees at no cost to landlords. \n\n Please feel free to call or text me anytime at 917-723-9014.

I hold an M.F.A. from Columbia University, and have over eighteen years of experience tutoring and coaching, seven of them at two highly selective Manhattan agencies.  My resume and references are available on request.\n\nI've had great success coaching reluctant writers of all ages, both with and without diagnosed learning differences, including students for whom English is not the first language.\n\nI emphasize a holistic approach to the writing process.  I teach tools for increasing writing ease and expression, and can jump-start  blocked writers.  \n\nI enjoy helping students think about what they have to say, and engage with the process.\n\nPlease note:  I do not do the writing for the student in any situation where academic credit will be given. This includes application essays. All American colleges and universities have strict rules regarding this which you would be wise to follow.\n\nFor non-academic writing, however, I am available to work as a collaborator.\n \nMy rate for academic and professional writing coaching is $125 per hour.  \n\nFor long-term, non-academic co-writing projects, rates may be negotiated after an initial consultation.\n\nI work primarily in Manhattan and some parts of Brooklyn. Trips to other boroughs and surrounding counties may require higher fees because of extended travel time.  If you do not live nearby, however, I can help you choose a meeting location in Manhattan that will work for both of us.\n \nI meet with students either in their homes or in spare conference rooms at their offices, but have also used coffee shops with great success.\n \nFor more information, or to schedule an appointment, you can respond to the email above, or call (646) 417-0704 (No Texts, please), and leave a message.

I have my Bachelors and Masters degree focusing in photography.\nHave been shooting weddings for 7 and a half years! I am well reviewed with prices that aren't ridiculous. Packages start at $1450 for six hours with loads of polaroids for you and your guests (view on website) and also small prints. Your images come on a beautiful custom USB & box with your names on it. The deposit to hold the date is $550 and the rest is due on the day of your wedding. I work hard to create images you will love forever and also work closely with clients to ensure you get what you want. My work is definitely documentary style, you will get, real images instead of hundreds of posed shots. turnaround time is two weeks but you get a nice preview (40-60 images) within four days. \n\nTo add an engagement package is an additional $200 which must be added to the $550 deposit. Image turn around for those is three days! \n\nI'd love to chat!

Often children who have learned school French, or adults who have taken lessons, cannot order a meal or buy a plane ticket without stammering & stuttering - even after years of lessons!\n\nThey have not been taught to speak with a proper accent.\n\nAnd they cannot name common, everyday objects.\n\nThis French course, perhaps the first of its kind, corrects these deficiencies. It emphasizes correct speech, listening, & pronunciation.\n\nDo you want to REALLY learn French? To learn to speak the language, not just learn about it? \n\nDo you want to HAVE CONTROL over what comes out of your mouth? To have it be what you intended to say? Not just a gibberish soup?\n\nContact me now.\nAinna Manapat\ntete-a-tete@outlook.com\n\n\n\"I am an American who has been taking French lessons from Ainna once per week for nearly two years. I didn't know any French at all until I met my now girlfriend who was born and raised in France. I decided to take up lessons to learn how to speak with her family and I've made huge strides in the past 2 years....\n\nAinna's teaching method is very effective.... I have been told by French only speakers in France that I have a very good accent and that can be attributed to Ainna's teaching. She has the unique ability to teach me how to hear, identify and create the sounds that it takes to speak French correctly. Words that I found nearly impossible to say 2 years ago now come out easily. That's the result of Ainna's step-by-step accent training....\n\nShe makes the lessons fun and she is extremely encouraging. It's been very exciting to get a little bit better every week. I plan to continue with Ainna's services indefinitely.\"\n\n- John H., Upper West Side    ","title":"PRIVATE FRENCH LESSONS BY YALE GRAD FROM FRENCH-SPEAKING FAMILY","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/lss/d/private-french-lessons-by/6601566327.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nClassic Painting and Home Improvements Inc. \nRenovations and Remodeling Contractor\n\n516-921-0494\n\nFrom single rooms to whole house renovations \nIncluding: Frame to Finish Carpentry, kitchens, bathrooms, and Finished Basements and of coarse fine interior painting and finish carpentry.\n\nI have over 25 years experience in Home improvements, carpentry, and painting. \n\nTrust us if your Buying, Selling, or Fixing up a home or business .

Getting good grades and understanding the material often takes more than just class attendance or reading the text book. One-on-one tutoring is often the most effective way to comprehend and master college math and science.\nWhen you spend hours struggling over a general chemistry book or tearing your hair out over an incomprehensible algebra or calculus problem you can often end up very frustrated and confused. After a few of these frustrating sessions, it's common to doubt yourself and want to give up. You can avoid these unnecessary set backs by setting up regular tutoring sessions early on in the fall or spring semesters.\nI work with students throughout Manhattan and Queens. I know your time is valuable so I'll travel to a location that is convenient to you. Sessions run for 90 minutes or more and my fee is $55.00 an hour.\nI've been working full time for the past 9 years as a college and high school tutor. My approach focuses on the unique ways each student learns, and then I teach to those strengths. These college classes will still be challenging, but I'll help you build the skills you need to get better grades and master the material.\nI offer tutoring for the following college subjects:\nMath Courses\n\nAlgebra\nPrecalculus\nSingle- & Multi-Variable Calculus\nStatistics\nDiscrete Math\nLinear Algebra\nNumber Theory\n\nScience Courses\n\nGeneral Chemistry\nOrganic Chemistry\nPhysics\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions you may have or set up a first session.

Do you work out at the gym, lift weights, take yoga classes? If you are already living an active lifestyle, and want to use your hard-gained fitness to learn a martial art, Eizan Ryu Jujitsu may be for you. \n\nOr maybe you have not been working out enough, and want to start getting in shape. Jujitsu classes can provide an enjoyable and useful path toward that goal.\n\nEizan Ryu Jujitsu is a self-defense oriented martial art. Students practice a wide variety of techniques -- strikes, throws, foot sweeps, joint locks, chokes -- against attacks such as punches, knife attacks, and grabs from behind, the sort of attacks one might encounter in a mugging, assault or rape attempt. Emphasis is placed on evasive movement, on targeting the attacker's weak points, and on putting the attacker on the ground and controlling him there. This emphasis reduces the chance of being injured in an attack, enables a smaller person to defend themselves against a larger opponent, and gives one more options in dealing with a violent situation.\n\nAdditionally, Eizan Ryu Jujitsu offers one the chance to develop and explore one's physical abilities. Learning self defense techniques, and learning the falling and rolling skills which come with the training, one finds oneself using all of one's physical and mental resources. Developing and employing one's fitness, flexibility, strength, and coordination -- as well as one's focus and attention -- to learn this martial art inspires one to get fit and brings a sense of purpose to whatever kinds of physical training one has previously done. And we offer certain classes that are specifically designed to improve one's conditioning while at the same time learning self defense skills.\n\nAnd finally, Eizan Ryu Jujitsu classes are fun. While the training can be challenging, the dojo is a friendly, welcoming place. We are not competitive; everyone progresses at his or her own pace. New students most often work with senior students, and our senior students are skilled at teaching and encouraging beginners. Classes are structured so that beginners who already live a physically active lifestyle and who can train two or three times a week will make very real and gratifying progress in just a few months. And if you are not already in shape, you can take it slow and make steady, safe gains over time.\n\nYou can find out more about us by visiting our website at http://www.eizanryujujitsu.org/ . There, you will find videos of our work, biographies of instructors, and a brief history of the style.\n\nIf you are interested, come in and observe a class. Then, if it seems like something you would like to try, you may take a free trial class. Our dojo is located at 161 East 106th Street, on the ground floor. Our class schedule is as follows:\n\nTuesday   8:15 -- 10pm\nThursday 8:15 -- 10pm\nSaturday\t2:00 -- 4:00pm\nSunday    3:00 -- 5:00pm\n\nOur rates are among the lowest of any Manhattan martial arts school, because we are not a commercial dojo. Our instructors teach out of love of the art, and a desire to help others learn to defend themselves.\n\nIf you have any questions, or to schedule a trial class, please contact us at the above email address.

He furthered his studies with private training in several Tai Chi styles with masters from Hong Kong and China.\n\nSifu Tom has always maintained the utmost respect for other martial arts and has made it a lifelong goal to study and practice in the top martial arts of the world. He is a certified Burma Buddhist disciple and has also learned several external styles: the Northern & Southern Shaolin Kung Fu, Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai and Mixed Martial Arts.\n\nWith over 30 years in martial arts instruction, Sifu Tom has trained people from all walks of life. He has been teaching Tai Chi privately to a distinguished clientele since 1993; including celebrities, business leaders, and elite military forces, while frequently participating in martial arts demonstrations in New York and San Francisco. His teaching style distinguishes him from almost every other Sifu in that he focuses on the practical applications of Tai Chi for self-defense and combat training. His aim in running Iron Silk Martial Arts is to teach novices, intermediates, and experts according to the modern principles of Tai Chi and to the highest standards required by the Wu style.

I have professional audio and video gear in my own private studio, and I really enjoy developing and supporting other people's creative vision, be it artistic or product driven.\n\nA little about me: I have live experience both in small venues around NYC with my band and nationally as a soloist, nearing the completion of my latest album. I'm also a professional recording engineer and videographer serving independent artists, non-profits, corporate, lifestyle and beauty clients. \n\nWhile response to my music is consistently positive, selling myself isn't my strong suit. That's why I'm looking for someone who's savvy with social media, can help me leverage opportunities with more established bands/artists for regular performances from DC to Boston (but also nationally), thoughtful about creating relationships with vendors/festivals/events, and enthusiastic about developing a fan base. That said, my expectations are planted firmly in reality--I don't expect miracles.\n\nI generally pitch my sound as a blend of brooding acoustic Americana with soulful electric overtones that invite audiences of rock, folk, and country.

I play a lot of auditions and have been a regular accompanist for Theatreworks/USA and other theater companies, enabling me to hear what's said when the actor leaves the room.\n\nI frequently appear at clubs, restaurants, and theaters in and around the city.  Past music director and accompanist for Literally Alive, children's theater subsidiary of Victory Theatrical, and currently music director for Two Beans Productions, I am listed in Who's Who in Entertainment and Who's Who of American Women.  I also work with Broadway performers through Broadway Classroom, which offers workshops for children and adults from all over the world.\n\nAn important and unique adjunct of my work, for actors and dancers who are terrified of their singing auditions, is my class PERFORMANCE SINGING, now in its twenty-first (!) year.  The class provides a supportive, non judgmental atmosphere in which students can gain confidence and learn the skills needed to get up in front of an audience and sing without fear.  \n\nThe price?  Still a pretty incredible $160 for eight two-hour classes per term.  E-mail for more information or to be on my mailing list.\n\nI am always accepting new students.  I meet each student on whatever level he or she brings to the session.  Anyone can benefit from even one hour, and many come just once, to learn a song, record music for practice, or brush up before an audition.  Others study weekly or bi-weekly to hone skills and steadily improve their craft.\n\n\nSTUDIO INFORMATION\n$50/hour--$30/half hour\n\nUpper East Side\n\nericakaplanpianist@gmail.com\n\nwww.ericakaplan.com    ","title":"VOCAL COACH / PIANIST","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/lss/d/vocal-coach-pianist/6601096343.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nI offer private chef services in home or delivered organic weekly meal plans.

I work at my home in Queens. In view of the present economic situation, in which money is tight, I have decided to lower my fee to $25 for an hour lesson.\n\nFollowing are a few success stories:\n\nSuccess Story # 1. A bright Stuyvesant student wanted to go to West Point. He was on the football team, was captain of the wrestling team, and had v.g. grades in everything -- except Latin where he was getting in the 40s. To get into West Point, you have to have a perfect record. We had 25 lessons in Latin, and he got 95 in the Regents exam. That September, he entered West Point.\n\n\nSuccess Story #2. A middle-aged man who had been a technician at a big telecommunications company for 25 years was finally offered a desk job. But, after a few weeks, top management told him that his orders, memos and reports were not in good enough English. We had thirteen 3-hour lessons, after which the management said his English had improved a great deal. He is now an executive of the company.\n\n\nSuccess Story #3. A boy who was smart but had been slacking off wanted to go to the Bronx High School of Science, where his best friend was. We had about 20 lessons, and he got in. He is now an accomplished musician, who has been on T.V.\n\n\nSuccess Story #4. A girl who was very good in math but only so-so in English wanted to go to Barnard. After a number of lessons, I suggested that she consider some 2nd-ranked colleges too, as her reading-comprehension ability was not improving very much. She visited a number of colleges, and decided she liked Mt. Holyoke very much (a 2nd-ranked school). She applied to several colleges of both ranks. Barnard and N.Y.U. said no, but Mt. Holyoke said yes. She is happy there, and thanked me for my advice.\n\n\nI could go on, but I think these 4 examples should suffice.\nFor more information, please call 718-424-1982 .\n\nIf I am not at home, be sure to leave a message. Call at any time, any day of the \nweek including Saturday and Sunday. Thank you.\n\nTheodore\n\nP.S. -- I am in touch with a number of other tutors.

Valid for first-time Rover customers only.About MeI have had 2 dogs throughout my life, Taco and Darcy, and have loved both of them with every ounce of my being! The hardest thing for me about moving to New York has been living without a dog to welcome me when I come home or to follow me around while I'm cooking dinner. Now that I am moving out of dorms and have an apartment in the city, my door is open to any dog! I'm a filmmaker, so I go on several walks a day to get my creativity flowing, and I love having a friend with me. I'm fully available over the summer, and I have an apartment one block from Tompkins Square Park! I can't wait to be around dogs again!About My ServicesI offer:  Dog Boarding: $45 per night.

NEED HELP WITH THOSE?\n \nLast fall, students I tutored were accepted by Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, Duke, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Tufts, Boston College, George Washington, accelerated medical programs and dozens of other highly desirable colleges. I tutored them for their SAT and ACT tests; they all worked hard and achieved the kind of scores that schools on their wish lists required. I helped many write great application essays, too!   (My SSAT and ISEE students have all gone on to prestigious private prep schools, too.)\n\nWHAT SCHOOLS WILL BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR WISH LIST?  Let me help you own your college dreams! I have worked with hundreds of students, most of whom have been accepted by several of their top choice colleges, universities and private secondary schools.\n\nLET ME HELP YOU OWN YOUR COLLEGE DREAMS!\n\nI realize how busy and pressured you are so I make your time spent with me and on assignments as efficient, effective and painless as possible.\n\nWho am I? A former university professor, I was trained in standardized test teaching techniques by two of the leading Test Prep companies. My personal SAT scores -- as well as my scores on every standardized test I have ever taken -- have ranked in the 99+ percentile.  \n\nIn more than 10 years of test prep tutoring, I have discovered test-taking tips and techniques that are never revealed by mass-produced courses and books. \n\nTogether, we will spend our tutoring time working on what you - personally - need to succeed. I will work with you one-on-one, analyzing your individual strengths and weaknesses and teaching you how to really take the SAT and ACT based on your individual test-taking, subject matter review, and essay writing needs. Along the way, we'll also work on building the kind of confidence that can carry you to your highest possible scores in all the verbal, math and writing tests.\n\nNOW IS THE TIME TO GET MOVING!\n\nYou probably would not be reading this unless you, or someone you know, could use some help prepping for their SAT or ACT tests or working on their college application essays so...\n\nLet's have a conversation. Contact me and we can talk about how I can help you.\n\nTalk to you soon,\n\n Judy\n    ","title":"Time to Tutor for SAT &  ACT Tests & Write College App Essays!","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/jsy/lss/d/time-to-tutor-for-sat-act/6600772398.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWe specialize in emergency plumbing repairs in  New York City. \n\nFrom boilers, water heaters, gas lines, leaks.

At this point, you will have received an email with all of the information you will need regarding your vehicle transport.\n\nStep 2: Inspection & Preparation\n\nYour dedicated auto transport coordinator will now assist you in preparing your vehicle for transport.  Your vehicle will be inspected for any pre-existing damage.  It will then be loaded on its trailer and begin transport to its destination.\n\nStep 3: Tracking Your Vehicle\n\nThroughout your vehicle's trip, your highly screened and trained driver will keep your transport coordinator apprised of your vehicle's location. Once your vehicle is 2-4 hours from its destination, your driver will contact you to ensure that delivery is made on time.\n\nStep 4: Inspection & Delivery\n\nOnce your vehicle has arrived safely at its destination, you will inspect it - please note that damage caused from vehicle transport is very rare with most auto shipping companies.  At this time, you will note and sign the updated Bill of Lading, retaining a copy for yourself.  Your remaining balance will be paid to your driver upon delivery, as agreed upon by the terms of your contract.\nThe Leader in Auto Transportation Services Throughout the United States    ","title":"Fast & Reliable Auto Transport - CAR SHIPPING ANYWHERE IN THE US","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/aos/d/fast-reliable-auto-transport/6600673114.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWelcome to ArcadePlay and Tournament... \n\nJoin us at 247 Water Street Brooklyn, N.Y. on June 8th from 4:30 til 8:30 PM and at The Art Factory in Paterson, N.J. on July 1st. from 1 til 5 PM.

This means you can create property protection both indoors and outdoors like never before.\n\nIf you are looking to secure a small condo or apartment, a simple wireless camera might just do the trick. It will also save you the higher cost of installing a traditional surveillance system. But if you need the extra coverage, no worries -- Home Security Store has you covered.\n\nTypically, a complete surveillance kit will be made up of a series of cameras connected (be that wired or wirelessly) to a DVR which records those images and in turn displays those images on a monitor. In addition, most of our advanced DVRs are capable of being connecting to a network that can send your CCTV images to an outside internet ready computer or smart phone. In turn, such smart phone applications allow you to control your surveillance system from afar 24/7\n\nRemember, the mere presence of video surveillance cameras can help prevent crime, from a residential home invasion to business vandalism. Furthermore, it can help obtain the evidence you need if a crime does actually happen. Video surveillance has been helpful in the conviction of many criminals. Often, if your cameras are positioned right, you can not only get a good image of a trespasser, but can even track his or her movement with different camera set-ups. Don't let the criminal have the upper hand. Build your surveillance system today.\n    ","title":"4-8-16 CAMERA SYSTEMS INSTALLED-COLOR NIGHT VISION SECURITY CAMERAS","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/biz/d/camera-systems-installed/6600409008.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nGOTSECURITYCAMERAS.COM\n516-503-2826\n\nPE PREPARED AND PROTECT WHATS YOURS\nINSTALL SECURITY CAMERAS NOW\n\nWWW.GOTSECURITYCAMERAS.COM\n516-503-2826\n\nDO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CAMERA SYSTEM AND NEED IT INSTALLED?\nGIVE US A CALL\n516-503-2826\nWWW.GOTSECURITYCAMERAS.COM\n\n4 CAMERA SYSTEM INSTALLED $1099\n8 CAMERA SYSTEM INSTALLED $1499\n16 CAMERA SYSTEM INSTALLED $2899\n\nDO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN SYSTEM?

It is not just businesses and commercial properties that need good security but it is our homes too. With crime increasing and burglaries very common place, it is very important to consider the available security options and choose one that is the best fit for you.\n\nOne of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment. CCTV cameras can act as a very successful deterrent to thieves and burglars, certainly making them think twice at the very least. The technology behind security equipment these days is incredibly advanced, and it is even possible to hook the cameras up to an ordinary television or computer to watch the footage.\n\nDigital Security surveillance cameras are much smaller. Despite their size, they are capable of recording video for a long period. The images and videos they record can be saved and edited in a computer. They have gained in popularity because they have eliminated the need for video tapes as a recording medium.\n\nThe presence of security systems have helped in deterring crimes and theft. This reputation has helped them become popular with homes and businesses. Through the years, security surveillance camera systems have become more affordable. For this reason, more and more households and businesses are being equipped with security cameras with the hopes of protecting their properties.\n\nOverall, the importance of a residential security system has become more and more undeniable. There are a lot of intruders who are wary of security cameras and are well aware that they can be easily be tracked by law enforcers if they ever get caught in one. They get discouraged with just the sight of it. One of the major benefits of having a video surveillance system is safety. The installation of surveillance systems gives home owners and business owners a peace of mind.\n\nWWW.GOTSECURITYCAMERAS.COM\n516-503-2826\nCALL NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE\n516-503-2826\n\n    ","title":"SECURITY CAMERAS-$1099 4 CAMERAS INSTALLED - 24/7 VIEW & NIGHT VISION","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/biz/d/security-camerascameras/6600407794.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nAre you looking for a professional house cleaner or a team of experienced cleaners?\n\nCall Top Mop!\n\nTop Mop has been cleaning homes, offices and post-construction sites from 2013\n\nWe are insured and bonded!\n\nAvailable 7 days a week.\n\n(855) 586-7667\n\nwww.TopMopInc.com\n\n\n\n\n\nQUALITY HOUSE CLEANING.
