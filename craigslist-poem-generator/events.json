We are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing.  We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.\nYou will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God's love!  After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.\nSo, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.  We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit/energy or what you will.

YES!). I am from India. I started doing yoga when I was sixteen. I was absolutely inflexible. I used to look at other students to figure out the next move in downward facing dog. In a class of twenty I wasn't even able to do a child's pose which was extremely frustrating. (Does any of it sound familiar to you?)\nI knew yoga is something that would change my life so instead of learning it in a class of 20 students, I travelled to ORRISA, INDIA in 2007 where I met my teacher, mentor  GURU RAVI SHANKAR and he taught me the ART OF LEARNING how to DO YOGA the RIGHT WAY. \nToday I have eleven years of personal practice under my belt. I am also a CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR  (Vinyasa Sequence) from YOGA VIDA, SOHO, NEW YORK.\nI have trained people with no prior yoga experience and zero flexibility. Yoga is like body building. You will not go to the gym and start doing a bicep curl with a 30lbs dumbbell, would you? Similarly why do downward facing dog in the first class of yoga where people have zero to very minimal of flexibility? It breaks my heart when people in America refer to yoga as \"dancer's workout\" or \"Gymnastics Stretches\" whereas in India it was available to people from the age group of 8 to 90. \nJust have your own yoga mat and allow me to guide you how to CONFIDENTLY go to a yoga class and not be confused what to do next and how to do it CORRECTLY.\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n++++++++++the fastest way to reach out to me is through whats app text-   show contact info\n+++++++++++\n\n\n*After the first class, depending upon your flexibility I will design a customize Yoga Plan that is specifically designed to reach your goals \n\n    ","title":"***********PRIVATE YOGA LESSONS  $70/HR***********","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/cls/d/private-yoga-lessons-70-hr/6588767499.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nCollege Music Teacher who loves to work with Adult Beginners and those returning to the piano.

We are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing.  We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.\nYou will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God's love!  After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.\nSo, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.  We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit/energy or what you will.

YES!). I am from India. I started doing yoga when I was sixteen. I was absolutely inflexible. I used to look at other students to figure out the next move in downward facing dog. In a class of twenty I wasn't even able to do a child's pose which was extremely frustrating. (Does any of it sound familiar to you?)\nI knew yoga is something that would change my life so instead of learning it in a class of 20 students, I travelled to ORRISA, INDIA in 2007 where I met my teacher, mentor  GURU RAVI SHANKAR and he taught me the ART OF LEARNING how to DO YOGA the RIGHT WAY. \nToday I have eleven years of personal practice under my belt. I am also a CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR  (Vinyasa Sequence) from YOGA VIDA, SOHO, NEW YORK.\nI have trained people with no prior yoga experience and zero flexibility. Yoga is like body building. You will not go to the gym and start doing a bicep curl with a 30lbs dumbbell, would you? Similarly why do downward facing dog in the first class of yoga where people have zero to very minimal of flexibility? It breaks my heart when people in America refer to yoga as \"dancer's workout\" or \"Gymnastics Stretches\" whereas in India it was available to people from the age group of 8 to 90. \nJust have your own yoga mat and allow me to guide you how to CONFIDENTLY go to a yoga class and not be confused what to do next and how to do it CORRECTLY.\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n++++++++++the fastest way to reach out to me is through whats app text-   show contact info\n+++++++++++\n\n\n*After the first class, depending upon your flexibility I will design a customize Yoga Plan that is specifically designed to reach your goals \n\n    ","title":"***********PRIVATE YOGA LESSONS  $70/HR***********","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/cls/d/private-yoga-lessons-70-hr/6588767499.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nCollege Music Teacher who loves to work with Adult Beginners and those returning to the piano.

We are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing.  We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.\nYou will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God's love!  After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.\nSo, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.  We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit/energy or what you will.

YES!). I am from India. I started doing yoga when I was sixteen. I was absolutely inflexible. I used to look at other students to figure out the next move in downward facing dog. In a class of twenty I wasn't even able to do a child's pose which was extremely frustrating. (Does any of it sound familiar to you?)\nI knew yoga is something that would change my life so instead of learning it in a class of 20 students, I travelled to ORRISA, INDIA in 2007 where I met my teacher, mentor  GURU RAVI SHANKAR and he taught me the ART OF LEARNING how to DO YOGA the RIGHT WAY. \nToday I have eleven years of personal practice under my belt. I am also a CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR  (Vinyasa Sequence) from YOGA VIDA, SOHO, NEW YORK.\nI have trained people with no prior yoga experience and zero flexibility. Yoga is like body building. You will not go to the gym and start doing a bicep curl with a 30lbs dumbbell, would you? Similarly why do downward facing dog in the first class of yoga where people have zero to very minimal of flexibility? It breaks my heart when people in America refer to yoga as \"dancer's workout\" or \"Gymnastics Stretches\" whereas in India it was available to people from the age group of 8 to 90. \nJust have your own yoga mat and allow me to guide you how to CONFIDENTLY go to a yoga class and not be confused what to do next and how to do it CORRECTLY.\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n++++++++++the fastest way to reach out to me is through whats app text-   show contact info\n+++++++++++\n\n\n*After the first class, depending upon your flexibility I will design a customize Yoga Plan that is specifically designed to reach your goals \n\n    ","title":"***********PRIVATE YOGA LESSONS  $70/HR***********","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/cls/d/private-yoga-lessons-70-hr/6588767499.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nCollege Music Teacher who loves to work with Adult Beginners and those returning to the piano.

We are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing.  We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.\nYou will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God's love!  After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.\nSo, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.  We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit/energy or what you will.

YES!). I am from India. I started doing yoga when I was sixteen. I was absolutely inflexible. I used to look at other students to figure out the next move in downward facing dog. In a class of twenty I wasn't even able to do a child's pose which was extremely frustrating. (Does any of it sound familiar to you?)\nI knew yoga is something that would change my life so instead of learning it in a class of 20 students, I travelled to ORRISA, INDIA in 2007 where I met my teacher, mentor  GURU RAVI SHANKAR and he taught me the ART OF LEARNING how to DO YOGA the RIGHT WAY. \nToday I have eleven years of personal practice under my belt. I am also a CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR  (Vinyasa Sequence) from YOGA VIDA, SOHO, NEW YORK.\nI have trained people with no prior yoga experience and zero flexibility. Yoga is like body building. You will not go to the gym and start doing a bicep curl with a 30lbs dumbbell, would you? Similarly why do downward facing dog in the first class of yoga where people have zero to very minimal of flexibility? It breaks my heart when people in America refer to yoga as \"dancer's workout\" or \"Gymnastics Stretches\" whereas in India it was available to people from the age group of 8 to 90. \nJust have your own yoga mat and allow me to guide you how to CONFIDENTLY go to a yoga class and not be confused what to do next and how to do it CORRECTLY.\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n++++++++++the fastest way to reach out to me is through whats app text-   show contact info\n+++++++++++\n\n\n*After the first class, depending upon your flexibility I will design a customize Yoga Plan that is specifically designed to reach your goals \n\n    ","title":"***********PRIVATE YOGA LESSONS  $70/HR***********","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/cls/d/private-yoga-lessons-70-hr/6588767499.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nCollege Music Teacher who loves to work with Adult Beginners and those returning to the piano.

We are dedicated teachers and students of A Course in Miracles (ACIM) who are waiting to share miracles with you through our ACIM Healing.  We ask the Holy Spirit to bring us directly to whatever seed thought is causing your current issues and we share forgiveness and bear witness to the miracles that are happening in all areas of your life. Bring any issue you are facing right now physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, or whatever or just bring your shining spirit, and receive a short session of energy work.\nYou will experience healing by the Holy Spirit through our healers' hands. Together, we create a Holy Triangle, consisting of the Holy Spirit and two brothers (you and a healer), to be the witnesses of miracles together. Together, we can help each other to accept God's love!  After your healing we might whisper to you a brief message that we receive from the Holy Spirit about what is going on in your energy field. Otherwise, we don't talk or discuss ACIM during this meetup event. We share healing quietly instead and provide you with an opportunity to come to rest, reflect, and remember who you truly are, in a supportive, non-judgmental, meditative environment.\nSo, rather than offering your advice, we'd like to offer you an opportunity to experience stillness of mind and peace so that you can return to harmony with your true nature and purpose. Then you will find that rather than needing \"solutions\" to \"problems\" you will realize that you have no problems except those that you project.  We call this spiritual healing but it is not religious nor connected with any church or group. It is simply a practice of meditating together on our true nature and connecting with universal spirit/energy or what you will.

YES!). I am from India. I started doing yoga when I was sixteen. I was absolutely inflexible. I used to look at other students to figure out the next move in downward facing dog. In a class of twenty I wasn't even able to do a child's pose which was extremely frustrating. (Does any of it sound familiar to you?)\nI knew yoga is something that would change my life so instead of learning it in a class of 20 students, I travelled to ORRISA, INDIA in 2007 where I met my teacher, mentor  GURU RAVI SHANKAR and he taught me the ART OF LEARNING how to DO YOGA the RIGHT WAY. \nToday I have eleven years of personal practice under my belt. I am also a CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR  (Vinyasa Sequence) from YOGA VIDA, SOHO, NEW YORK.\nI have trained people with no prior yoga experience and zero flexibility. Yoga is like body building. You will not go to the gym and start doing a bicep curl with a 30lbs dumbbell, would you? Similarly why do downward facing dog in the first class of yoga where people have zero to very minimal of flexibility? It breaks my heart when people in America refer to yoga as \"dancer's workout\" or \"Gymnastics Stretches\" whereas in India it was available to people from the age group of 8 to 90. \nJust have your own yoga mat and allow me to guide you how to CONFIDENTLY go to a yoga class and not be confused what to do next and how to do it CORRECTLY.\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers\n++++++++++the fastest way to reach out to me is through whats app text-   show contact info\n+++++++++++\n\n\n*After the first class, depending upon your flexibility I will design a customize Yoga Plan that is specifically designed to reach your goals \n\n    ","title":"***********PRIVATE YOGA LESSONS  $70/HR***********","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brx/cls/d/private-yoga-lessons-70-hr/6588767499.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nCollege Music Teacher who loves to work with Adult Beginners and those returning to the piano.

All you need is a needle, thread, and some fabric. I've been sewing for 15+ years now and I love it!\n\nDo you want to learn how to sew? If so, I can teach you how to sew by hand or machine. It's fun and easy once you learn how to do a few basic techniques. Allow me to teach you how to sew!\n\nYou will learn basic sewing skills like how to thread your machine and/or needle, how to sew straight lines, zigzag lines, whip stitches and most importantly how to sew two pieces of fabric together. \n\nMy sessions are very affordable and you can come to my place or I can meet you at yours. We can schedule a 1-hour class at your earliest convenience.  \n\nReach out to me by email or call or text me here  show contact info\n for more details if you are interested in learning how to sew.
