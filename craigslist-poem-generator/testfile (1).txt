During a night out in Park Slope last Saturday evening May 12, 2018, from approximately 10:30 PM to 12:15 AM, I dropped or otherwise misplaced my men's brown wallet with some credit cards, ID cards, in one of the following places: Freddy's; Skylark; a southbound B63 bus; a northbound green taxi hail; or anywhere around those places (on the ground on 5th Avenue, or in a flower bed on 6th Street, for example).

My passport fell out of my pocket between those 5 blocks and when I turned around to look for it, it was gone so I'm assuming somebody picked it up.

Dog ran out AND we are desperately looking for him.
After 6 days and 5 nights of searching, and the tremendous help from the neighbors, we caught Reese about 2 miles from home.
From that point, we were able to post flyers, hand out flyers and talk with people who lived near the area of where he had been seen last.

I AM LOOKING FOR A 15-18 LBS POODLE.
We had no way of knowing where he was, or where to start to look for him.
He was near a major highway and in a wooded area that contained foxes, coyotes, and bear.
