Perhaps it is so you would have an extra one to donate and save a life! \n- Dr. Stuart Greenstein, Kidney Transplant Surgeon, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY  "We are born with approximately 4-5 times the kidney function that we need, to be healthy and stay off of dialyisis- to not have kidney failure. So by donating one of your kidneys, you are still left with with 2-3 times the amount of kidney function that you need to be healthy and lead a normal life\" \nJoseph Del Pizzo. Vice Chairman, Department of Urology, Associate Professor of Urology and Transplantation Surgery , Weill Cornell Medical College - New York, NY "Kidney donation is a relatively safe operation, and many donors will never feel the loss of their second kidney. So giving up a kidney causes no disadvantage to your long-term health. In fact, studies have shown, that kidney donors actually live longer than the general population - because donors come from a pool of people in good health\"\n- Dr. Michael Edye, former Adjunct Associate Professor of surgery, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY "Very Safe Operation\"\n- Dr. Jay Levine, General Surgeon, St., Mary's Health Care, West Michigan, MI  "Those who donate a kidney have an \"extremely low\" risk of developing kidney failure in their remaining organ, U.S. researchers. \"It's certainly safer than many other things we choose to do in our lives,\" -- Dr. Dorry Segev, transplant surgeon at John Hopkins For the article - http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/8533487.html "Once people have recuperated from the surgery -- they should be 100% completely normal - no special diet, no limitation on their exercises , no special medications.\" -- Dr. Lloyd Ratner, Director, Renal and Pancreatic Transplant Program, surgeon -- NY Presbytarian -- Columbia Medical Center "There's a lot of misconceptions about kidney donation and a lot of fear. But if people take the time to get the facts, they find out the risks are very minimal. People are born with two kidneys. You only lneed one.\" \n- Michelle Winsor, Kidney Transplant Coordinator, Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, CA QUOTES FROM PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DONATED A KIDNEY:  "People always ask me why I donated my kidney - and I always respond with, why wouldn't I donate a kidney? I had 41 surgeries in my life and the kidney donation was the easiest surgery of them all\" - John Feal, Long Island, NY - 9/11 responder, who donated a kidney to a stranger.

So by donating one of your kidneys, you are still left with with 2-3 times the amount of kidney function that you need to be healthy and lead a normal life\" \n- Dr. Joseph Del Pizzo.

This would be a paid opportunity. You can be any age (18 and over), any height and any weight. The only requirement is that you are someone who is openminded and has a positive attitude. You do not have to be a model in the traditional sense. I have worked with women of all shapes and sizes.  The theme of the video would be female domination/empowerment. If you are dominant, that is great, but even if you are shy and new to this type of thought-process, that is perfectly fine too. The most important thing is to be genuine in your interest.. A positive attitude can make all the difference and is something I value more than physical attributes on these video shoots.  If this is new to you, you would be coached and guided the whole way. It is a fun, laid back, and easy going video shoot. I will be as clear as I can be when I say that in no way is this an ad to have sex or do anything illegal. The video shoot is erotic but no sex is involved at all. I do not and will not push the boundaries of bordering on anything illegal. Any and all compensation would be strictly for modeling services. The video is for private use and is not made public. You would have this in writing. For more information, respond with your age, height and a photo. I will provide full details via email.

You can stop wondering how John Bonham felt when playing Moby Dick, or how it feels to kick a bass drum or snap a rimshot on the snare drum. Even more important, you can learn how to connect with music behind a drum set. It doesn't matter if you don't have any experience at all, we'll make it happen! On the other hand, if you're an already-practiced drummer who wants to get your playing to the next level, I can help you with your hand/foot technique, extend your vocabulary in different styles, improve your sense of time and feel, develop your independence, improve your reading and explore more advanced concepts (odd time signatures, soloing, phrasing, applying rudiments to the drum set, metric modulation) to help you out in your journey as a musician and break those walls that are preventing you from growing as a drummer.  The lessons can be held at my studio in Brooklyn (Williamsburg) . You just need to bring your sticks (if you don't have any, it's ok, I have plenty :) and be ready to play drums. I work with  students with different levels, backgrounds and needs, so please -- tell me about your story, your musical tastes, your experience with the instrument (or other ones) and what would you like to learn, so I can help you in your journey with drums. I like to tailor my lessons to each student because everyone is different ;) The 1st lesson is free, so you can see if I might be the right fit for you.

I'll help you develop your sense of rhythm so this will be much easier for you to do). - EAR TRAINING: (learn how to copy what you hear off your favorite CD'S, how to improvise and understand the theory behind your favorite basslines). - READING: (how key signatures work, notes on the music staff, value of each note, and much more). +> My teaching methods are unique, and I guarantee you'll improve quickly, no matter how long you've been playing. All lessons are geared to the type of music you like to play, but what you learn can be applied to any style of music. +> I have reasonable rates and a flexible schedule. I'm very patient, and do my best to teach in an enjoyable, no pressure way.

","title":"parakeets","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/pet/d/parakeets/6601391511.html"},{"body":" Hello. =)\n\n🌱🌸🌻🐾🌱 Heads-up, it's a long one. If you're not in my shoes on the receiving end of fielding replied, you don't know the type of odd messages I'd otherwise receive. It's next to impossible to know who is sincere and who is attempting to stir drama if not for a solid offer.  I've therefore decided to answer all conceivable questions upfront for mutual comfort and to avoid repeating the same information numerous times which conceivably would prevent having the time for the ride.  I am a pretty, sweet, slender, post-grad in advanced studies, traditional, friendly, sociable, Caucasian female. Some of you may view these details as excessive for an activities post, but I have nothing to hide and noticed that some folks here are superficial and if a basic description is not included, it's the first thing asked. I decide on a seasonal basis when I have sufficient personal belongings to donate in the city and/or on SI. This requires storage, sorting and organization that for which I have the space and trusted assistance on SI. I also at times visit SI to assist one or more parties in need with basic to-dos.  In some situations the personal belongings I must transport there, back or both are too cumbersome for public transit and/or an express bus to the area is unavailable at the time I must schedule to be in or to leave the area or the travel time needed for public transportation there (no trains) or my other commitments in the city do not make it possible for me to be there in time. Although I enjoy walking, one of the areas I must visit on a regular basis is a winding road without a sidewalk parallel to oncoming traffic.  In addition, most of my friends in the city don't keep a car here (or it's a small 2-seater that doesn't work for the needs the day of the plan), our schedules might not be conducive or sometimes, they're not in town. They've offered to loan me their car but I do not drive. To clarify and allay any potential concerns:\n\n- No drugs, alcohol or smoking.\n- No illegal or questionable activities.\n- No se~ual intimations, overtures or attempts.\n- No worries  The trunk and back seat space of a coupe or 4 wheel drive is more than suitable, but sometimes a two-seater will do if it's just followup organization or being there for basics that doesn't bringing much with me.  I'm looking to plan one or more, preferably, round-trip rides, but will accept one-way offers as well, from the city to SI and back, as needed. For some of the planned trips and locations, if/when there's an express bus, then the ride won't be needed both ways. Although I'm admittedly not a fan of public transit, it's fairly comfortable.  The ideal is if you're able to pick me up in the city and drop me off at the first destination on SI and then to alert you when I'm about wrapped up there and ready to arrive at the next destination or to return to the city, whichever is the agreed upon plan.  The next trip to SI is planned for one or more days this week, presuming sufficient notice of the ride (preferable at least a day or 24 hrs in advance) to confirm with the applicable schedules of all parties.  An arrival time at the location on SI anytime from early morning, early afternoon or lunch hour seems best offhand. I generally depart SI in the late afternoon to early evening. Depending on the day, I may need to find someone to cover at work, so again, sufficient notice is best.  Please don't request pics since it's CL and sharing pics means I have no idea where they may wind up. The areas where you will pick me up in the city and/or drop me off on SI are residential, upper class, safe and secure where security surveillance applies. There's no reason to be concerned for safety if your intentions are respectable. The location is about 40 min by car without traffic and 45-60 min with traffic. The main route is the FDR to BQE (or Bklyn Battery Tunnel to circumvent traffic) to the Verazzano Bridge. The toll is one-way only to SI. Some prefer to drive through NJ to get to SI or to circumvent traffic when it's heavy. If you'd like to pass the time on SI and are unfamiliar, the area is near Latourette Golf Course, Museum of Tibetan Art, NYCPL, Barnes and Noble, Historic Richmond Town, lots of shopping, such as DSW, TJ Maxx, Marshall's, Target, Best Buy, Trader Joe's, Burlington, Costco, Home Depot, HomeGoods, Kohl's, and the SI Mall, restaurants, parks, tennis courts, and with a bit of a ride, the Staten Island Zoo, Snug Harbor Cultural Center or South Beach and the FDR Boardwalk. If you're a polite, respectful, considerate male who enjoys driving and wouldn't mind offering the one-way or round-trip ride from the city and/or back, then I'd like to hear from you. Please let me know the days and hours that you're able. By decent, respectful and considerate, you understand a sense of protocol and how to behave around a lady without being asked. You are sufficiently secure financially to not sweat covering gas and tolls as a gentleman or have an EZ-Pass, not unnecessarily dramatic or anxious, and offer the ride as your pleasure and/or as an adventure or easy-going, pleasant yet different way to socialize and meet someone new or a way of giving back. I'm prepared to arrange lunch or dinner as a small gesture if you let me know in your reply that it's appreciated and dietary restrictions, if any. Please include email, mobile, location and the hours you're able so that I may view your offer as genuine and have a quick, direct means to confirm a solid plan. If it's not clear, I will respond with contact information once a plan has been confirmed. To the guys who had been kind and reliable to offer such a ride in the past when a personal ride didn't come through, thanks again. No rude, condescending, sarcastic, unsolicited opinions or replies. If you are not willing and able to arrange the ride this time or another time, please do not respond. Thank you.  Have a blessed day. 🌱🐾🌻🌸🌱    ","title":"Reliable, respectful gent who enjoys driving wanted for ride","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/act/d/reliable-respectful-gent-who/6601360050.html"},{"body":" Hello  musicians,..im a creative solid  drummer ... with time !.looking to jam or record /gig ..rnb ..roots , funk/rap  , dance/pop ..GROOVE in blues !..thanks talk to me ..experienced only..

Fast turnaround time. Last minute emergency work can be arranged - without any extra cost. I treat each instrument as if it were my own. * Satisfaction guaranteed on all work. I'll work on your instrument until you're completely happy with it. I will definitely make your guitar or bass guitar play and/or sound better - let me prove it to you. * At least two hours of work goes into each setup. I don't do \"quickies\". What others charge extra for is already included in my standard setups. Your instrument will come out the best it can possibly be. * Just some of what goes into a complete setup includes adjusting the trussrod in the neck, filing the slots in the nut to lower the action at the headstock, adjusting the bridge saddles to lower the action at the bridge, setting the intonation of the the bridge, filing and recrowning any high frets, smoothing out any rough fret edges, cleaning and oiling the fingerboard, polishing the frets, adjusting the height of the pickups, adjusting the tension of the tuners, flushing (cleaning) out the electronics, tightening any loose screws and fittings, changing and stretching the strings (if necessary), and giving the guitar a complete cleaning. If you like, I can lightly sand the back of the neck and slightly round edges of the fingerboard (this is called \"rolling the edges\") to simulate a \"vintage\" feel. The charge for a complete guitar or 4 string bass setup would be in the area of $50 to $60. * If you like, you can even stay and watch me work on your instrument.

If I find a potential problem once you leave, I call you to discuss further repair.\n5. My set ups are a huge value at $55. In order to get a set up of this quality elsewhere, you'd pay $80 or more. \n6. If you are apprehensive about leaving an expensive guitar with me the first time, we can arrange for a while you wait set up.\n7. I have been repairing & setting up guitars & basses for over 35 years. Ask how long the techs at the music stores have been doing this.\n8.

I have a wide range of music likes including rock, pop, jamband, blues, r&b/soul, country, jazz and jazz fusion. I'm mainly looking for a rock band doing primarily original material, anywhere from a Springsteen, Clash or Pretenders type straight-ahead rock band to possibly a Grateful Dead type jamband. (Hey, 2 drummers, bring it!!! And, if you're another drummer who wants to get together to play, let me know!) However, I'm definitely open to other musical possibilities as well. (If you're the next Amy Winehouse, you need to contact me immediately!) I'm also looking for paying situations, and I'm available to teach.  I'm in NYC, in Manhattan. I have a rehearsal space that I can use on a limited basis. I'm older, so if you're looking for that typical \"age 20-28\" range, well, you can count me out. I've done a lot of playing in clubs, bars and dives as well as my fair share of weddings, bar mitzvahs and Top 40, playing both originals and covers. I also tend to get very involved in bands' organizational needs, including doing a lot of the booking for many of the people I play with.

I've put together the core of a band that will be able to broach a great many styles, but will primarily be rooted in Americana, rock and roll and blues with elements of R&B and country, as well as other styles. We'll be able to rock, but to also tone it down. Optimally, we will be focusing on originals, sprinkled with some covers. We all have a lot of experience in various bands and genres. We still need a singer(s) (male and/or female) and a rhythm guitarist, and possibly a keyboardist.  We rehearse at the Music Building on 8th Avenue, between West 38 - 39 Streets. Our age range varies widely. Currently, there is NO money involved.

Some background first. Once upon a time in the East Village, there was a bar that was ALWAYS EMPTY. DEAD. I started a live music policy there, and the bar ended up becoming extremely successful, and two bands that found a home there became MAJOR artists. The bar went from the ultimate dive to a very cool, and successful, gathering spot. I'm not promising instant success to club owners. I'm just looking for an hospitable environment where a band (or bands) can make itself at home, develop its music and help build a following and name for the club as well. I'm open to all kinds of suggestions. I'm a musician, more so than a promoter, but I'm willing to explore all opportunities.

I am calling to you;    I have a message for all humanity.\n\n5 You gullible people, acquire insight.    You naive ones, cultivate a heart that truly understands.\n\n6 Listen, for I am about to tell you of unparalleled excellence and beauty;    what I am about to say will set things right.\n\n7 I will only speak the truth;    I despise evil, so it will not pass through my lips.\n\n8 Everything I say promotes justice;    not one word is crooked, and nothing is distorted. 9 Each and every word is straight talk to perceptive people,    upright and honest to knowledge-seekers.

I am understanding, and strength belongs to me.\n\n15 It's because of me that kings wield power    and authorities decree what is right.\n\n16 It's because of me that leaders and their agents govern    and all judge according to what is right.\n\n17  I love those who love me;    those who search hard for me will find me.\n\n18 Riches and honor are the benefit of following me;    so are lasting wealth and justice.\n\n19 My reward is better than gold, even the purest gold;    and my profit is greater than the highest quality silver.\n\n20 I follow the way of right living.    Follow me along the path to find justice;\n\n21 I'm ready to meet those who love me, bestow true riches upon them,    and fill up their lives until their treasuries overflow.\n\n22 The Eternal created me; it happened when His work was beginning,    one of His first acts long ago.\n\n23 Before time He established me,    before the earth saw its first sunrise.\n\n24 I was born before the deep existed,    before any springs poured out their water,\n\n25 Before the mountains were placed on their foundations,    before the hills rolled across the land--    yes, before all this, I was brought forth.\n\n26 When the earth was yet unformed and the fields were not yet nestled beneath the wind--    even before the first dust of the earth--\n\n27 When He created the heavens, I was there.    When He drew a circle in the deep, dividing the oceans and the sky, I was there.\n\n28 I was there when He established the sky.    I was there when the springs in the deep were fortified;\n\n29 I witnessed Him lay down the shore as a boundary    and put limits on the water\n    And determine the foundations of the earth.\n\n30 All this time I was close beside Him, a master craftsman.    Every day I was His delightful companion,    celebrating every minute in His presence,\n\n31 Elated by the world He was making and all its fine creatures;\n    I was especially pleased with humanity. 32 So now listen to me, my children:    those who live by my ways will find true happiness.\n\n33 Pay attention to my guidance, dare to be wise,    and don't disregard my teachings.\n\n34 The one who listens to me,    who carefully seeks me in everyday things    and delays action until my way is apparent, that one will find true happiness.\n\n35 For when he recognizes and follows me, he finds a peaceful and satisfying life    and receives favor from the Eternal.\n\n36 But heed my warning: the one who goes against me will only hurt himself,    for all who despise me are playing with fire and courting death.

So, i've been looking for this song for like 20 years.  i used to hear it on new york city smooth jazz station CD 101.9 back in the 90s.  i have been on iTunes for YEARS listening to snippets of ALL albums of countless bands.  one may have to do a wikipedia and google search or the actual artist's websites.   My reward is obviously based on an honor system.  you'll send me a link and if it is the song i was looking for, i'll send you a check, do a paypal, bitcoin, litecoin, square cash, venmo or whatever you like.  i will keep my word but I know there is a certain amount of trust you have to have in me.  So here are the elements:   \n\n- the melody is played in unison by a sax, female or higher pitched male vocal (singing \"da da da\" vs just humming), a guitar, flute, electric piano, see the following songs for rough examples of this instrumentation.  \n\n- the verses sound musically interesting in a jazzy way, but the refrain sounds pretty elevator muzak smooth jazz.  \n\n- the song feels like a mix of chieli minucci, kenny g, paul brown, rippingtons and even a bit of pat metheny due to the nature of the melody.  although like I said, the refrain seems a bit simple and asinine, something pat metheny would never do.\n\n- the melody instrumentation feels like \"ozone alert\" by special EFX and especially the rhythm, it's exactly like that song, at least that's what i remember after 20 years. \n\n- altogether my 3 decade old awareness of smooth jazz results in me thinking it has to be a \"Special EFX\" tune.  but i researched all their music and canNOT find that song. wtf.   "going home\" special EFX is similar, NOT in melody or rhythm but in instrumentation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlUX2qhGxT8 \n\"may dance\" brian hughes - sound, instrumentation, vocals etc but NOT melody\n\"under one sky\"  - brian hughes - sound, instrumentation, vocals etc but NOT melody\n\"thin blue line\"  brian hughes - sound, instrumentation, vocals etc but NOT melody The youtube link below is a garage band recording i attempted of what i remember about the melody and song.  please don't laugh at my recording.  i have never done anything with garage band.  the melody, as far as i remember, is EXACTLY like this.  so it's not just an approximation here.   What's in it for you?   knowing you helped someone find something they treasured for such a long time. it's been driving me crazy not hearing this song again.  i am sure some of you can relate. My youtube says i am offering 25. - but i am willing to offer 150.- Thank you so much in advance for considering helping me out.

Hi, my name's Dana. I'm from New York and I attended the prestigious LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts in NYC and Duke University. I'm currently a working actress and I was nominated for a New York Innovative Theater Award for Outstanding Solo Performance. I've trained with some of the best acting teachers and I'm very good with students. I work to create a safe, non-critical environment, helping the actor find his or her own truthfulness and creativity in performance. An audition requires preparation, and we will go through the necessary steps to make sure the student feels confident on the big day. This will consist of choosing appropriate audition material, rehearsing the material, preparing for the \"cold-reading\" portion of the audition (which consists of performing a script given to the student a few minutes before their audition), as well as preparing for all possible occurrences during the audition that could throw an actor off their game.  The most important thing that acting should be is FUN, and that is always the goal in my coaching: to get the actor to be truthful and alive in the moment and having fun. The more an actor has fun in performance, the more the audience will enjoy watching them. Contact me to discuss. I look forward to hearing from you. References available upon request. You can also check out this informational video about the audition process: https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U "Wow! When [my son] first started working on these monologues [with Dana] it seemed like he didn't really like doing them. But now, I can tell he loves performing them and he's really excited to act.\" - M.N. "Stuart learned a lot of tips from [Dana] during his sessions and we liked her.

Anderson\t One of the most frequently repeated canards of the abortion debate is that pro-lifers really don't care about life. As much as they talk about protecting the unborn, we are told, pro-lifers do nothing to support mothers and infants who are already in the world. Liberal writers such as Matthew Yglesias are given to observing that pro-lifers believe that \"life begins at conception and ends at birth.\" At Commonweal, David Gibson, a journalist who frequently covers the abortion debate, asks how much pro-lifers do for mothers: \"I just want to know what realistic steps they are proposing or backing. I'm not sure I'd expect to hear anything from pro-life groups now since there's really been nothing for years.\" This lazy slander is as common as it is untrue. Of course, there is much more that needs to be done, but in the decades since Roe v. Wade, pro-lifers have taken the lead in offering vital services to mothers and infants in need. Operating with little support--and often actual opposition--from agencies, foundations, and local governments, pro-lifers have relied upon a network of committed donors and volunteers to make great strides in supporting mothers and their infants. It's time the media takes notice. In the United States there are some 2,300 affiliates of the three largest pregnancy resource center umbrella groups, Heartbeat International, CareNet, and the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA). Over 1.9 million American women take advantage of these services each year. Many stay at one of the 350 residential facilities for women and children operated by pro-life groups. In New York City alone, there are twenty-two centers serving 12,000 women a year. These centers provide services including pre-natal care, STI testing, STI treatment, ultrasound, childbirth classes, labor coaching, midwife services, lactation consultation, nutrition consulting, social work, abstinence education, parenting classes, material assistance, and post-abortion counseling. Religious groups also provide crucial services to needy mothers and infants. John Cardinal O'Connor, the late Archbishop of New York, famously pledged to assist any woman from anywhere experiencing a crisis pregnancy, and the current Archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, recently renewed Cardinal O'Connor's pledge. The Catholic Church--perhaps the single most influential pro-life institution in the United States--makes the largest financial, institutional, and personnel commitments to charitable causes of any private source in the United States. These include AIDS ministry, health care, education, housing services, and care for the elderly, disabled, and immigrants. In 2004 alone, 562 Catholic hospitals treated over 85 million patients; Catholic elementary and high schools educated over 2 million students; Catholic colleges educated nearly 800,000 students; Catholic Charities served over 8.5 million different individuals. In 2007, the Catholic Campaign for Human Development awarded nine million dollars in grants to reduce poverty. And in 2009, the Catholic Legal Immigration Network spent nearly five million dollars in services for impoverished immigrants. The Catholic Church is far from the only pro-life religious group that assists the needy. At the Manhattan Bible Church, a pro-life church in New York since 1973, Pastor Bill Devlin and his congregation run a soup kitchen that has served over a million people and a K-8 school that has educated 90,000 needy students. Pastor Devlin and other church families have adopted scores of babies, and taken in scores of pregnant women, including some who were both drug-addicted and HIV positive. The church runs a one-hundred-and-fifty-bed residential drug rehabilitation center and a prison ministry at Rikers Island. All told, the church runs some forty ministries, and all without a government dime. No major pro-abortion group or institution has taken on a comparable commitment to vulnerable Americans. Pregnancy resource centers devote significant resources to supporting women who have already decided to have an abortion, but abortion advocates offer no similar support to women who wish to continue their pregnancies. Indeed, they often devote their resources to shutting down the services provided by pro-lifers. NARAL Pro-Choice America reports spending twenty thousand dollars on \"crisis pregnancy centers\" in Maryland in order to \"investigate\" and publicly smear such centers for demonstrating a bias for life. (One might point out that the same bias once motivated the entire medical profession.) If pro-life Americans provide so many (often free) services to the poor and vulnerable--work easily discovered by any researcher or journalist with an Internet connection--why are they sometimes accused of caring only for life inside the womb? Quite possibly, it is the conviction of abortion advocates that \"caring for the born\" translates first and always into advocacy for government programs and funds. In other words, abortion advocates appear to conflate charitable works and civil society with government action. The pro-life movement does not. Rather, it takes up the work of assisting women and children and families, one fundraiser and hotline and billboard at a time. Still, the pro-life movement is not unsophisticated about the relationship between abortion rates and government policies in areas such as education, marriage, employment, housing, and taxation. The Catholic Church, for example, works with particular vigor to ensure that its social justice agenda integrates advocacy for various born, vulnerable groups, with incentives to choose life over abortion. One of the significant ironies of accusing pro-lifers of being \"anti-vulnerable,\" \"anti-women,\" and \"anti-poor\" is that poor women tend to be more pro-life than their more privileged counterparts. It is especially important, therefore, to offer them options that do not simply appeal to their economic interest or personal autonomy narrowly understood, but rather that accord with their moral outlook and overall wellbeing. Abortion advocates, however, continually argue that one public policy in particular--further increases in government-supplied birth control--can become a panacea for high abortion rates. However, there is more than a little doubt about the claimed relationship between contraception programs and abortion rates. Rather, in the altered sex and marriage markets made possible by contraception and legal abortion, more and more women engage in non-marital sex without any \"shotgun marriage\" guarantee in the event of pregnancy. This leads (ironically) to more non-marital pregnancies, more non-marital births, more sexually transmitted diseases, and (irony of ironies) more abortions. Figures out just in the past few weeks show that this contraception-related increase in abortion is not limited to the United States. In Spain, legal availability of birth control and abortion has drastically increased, with some 60 percent more women reporting that they used contraception in 2007 than in 1997. Over the same period, researchers found abortion rates more than doubled. The results of government policies promoting widespread contraception are clear: more of every outcome that birth control and abortion were promised to curb, including non-marital pregnancies, births, and abortions. Not to mention sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment; is it any coincidence that Planned Parenthood serves roughly the same percentage of clients for STIs (31%) as it does for contraception (36%)? No one doubts that birth control used in a particular instance of sexual intimacy increases a woman's chances of avoiding pregnancy. But the social policy of widely available birth control has been accompanied by an increase of out-of-wedlock births and abortions. In New York City some 41 percent of all viable pregnancies ended in abortion in 2009 despite the fact that the city distributed 40 million free condoms during the same year. The insistence that pro-lifers make birth control the centerpiece of a pro-life strategy has reaped a three-fold reward for abortion advocates. First, its surface logic (\"birth control equals no baby\") has blinded onlookers to the historical results of birth control as a social policy. Second, pro-lifers are easily tagged as \"religious zealots,\" ignoring the most obvious solution to abortion for irrational, theological reasons. Third, abortion advocates can claim to be women's best friend--by increasing sexual autonomy--despite the dubious effects of their proposed solution. In sum then, the charge should be laid to rest once and for all that the pro-life movement is not active on behalf of women, children, and vulnerable persons generally. Those bringing the charge--the same groups that do very little personally to help women and children--should be held to account, both for their lack of real charity and for their refusal to acknowledge that their entire strategy--state supplied birth control and unlimited abortion--has backfired upon the very groups they promised to help. While the pro-life cause has always been animated by the conviction that life begins at conception, it has never forgotten that it continues after birth. The pro-life movement's message has been vindicated by 40 years of legalized abortion: the personal dignity, happiness, and prosperity of women, children, men, and the nation is advanced when life is cherished both before and after birth.\n______________________________________\nHelen Alvare is associate professor at George Mason University School of Law and a senior fellow of the Witherspoon Institute.

I've tried this parenting thing 2 ways. I started out with a successful career working 50 hours a week and making decent money. The actual price I paid?😔😔 Sending my little guy to daycare from 6am to 6pm. Spending 2 hours a night with him and exhaustedly catching up on household chores and errands on the weekends. Only to start the routine all over again filled with guilt and a nagging feeling of unfulfillment. \"It's great watching other people raise your children for you!\" Said no one ever. On the other hand, fast forward two kids later.  I'm at home now.  I kiss my littles on the forehead every morning and happily wait for them to arrive at the bus stop every afternoon. When someone's sick, I don't ask anyone's permission to stay home and take care of them. I have time for help with homework and home-cooked meals. I don't stress to find a summer activity that will allow me to get to work on time. The Actual Price I Paid??😩😩 Long hours spent away from my loving and hardworking husband. Kids that miss their Papa because he commutes 2 hours a day so we don't have to put them in daycare. What if I said, it's ok to say \"no\"? It's Ok To Craft A Life That Feels Like Every Day Is Friday! What if I said, don't choose one or the other? Impossible, right? Wrong. It's true!  Me AND my spouse can kiss our littles on the forehead and send them off to school every morning! 😘 My family can take a 3 week vacation and not ask anyone's permission! ✈️🏝 I can craft a life in which the world is our children's playground!! Let me guess. Heard it before? Tried other internet opportunities and were let down? Me too! I've tried everything under the sun. But let me ask this.  Who's sitting in a living room right now after being \"tricked\" by a close friend that needed your \"opinion\" on an exciting opportunity?🤔 Not me! Nope. This is a fool proof system that includes a warm, loving community of inspiring and like-minded entrepreneurs. Support and guidance like no other team! And I don't have to be super \"techy\" because it's a formula Anyone can learn. I am now in the position to create my dream lifestyle and I want to help others too! Does this resonate? I'm looking for 10 more people to join my team. Let's do this! Send me an email with the subject: I'm Ready.  I would love to talk! I can't wait to connect!

It's past time we all \"SPIRITUALLY WAKE UP\"....be assured,  we are living on borrowed time and God's  mercy. Everything going on is a  \"Spiritual Setup\" to distract us from what's  \"REALLY\" about to happen. This world is in a Spiritual Battle for our souls,  The events going on worldwide is Biblical Prophecy being full filled before our eyes.  From the beginning of time Satan has rebelled against God. Satan has one purpose , to kill, steal, and destroy. He is a master deceiver and father of lies. This world is intoxicated with lust of the eye, drunkenness, lust of the flesh, greed, adultery, fornication,homosexuality, porn, sexual perversion of every sort. Corruption and Wickedness in high places has created a Godless society .  ( Prisons are over flooded because Prayer, Jesus, and the Bible is rejected in Schools,  etc. ) Rebellion against God's word is sin, and sin causes Spiritual ignorance and Spiritual blindness leading to eternal Spiritual damnation / death. GOD IS A HOLY GOD:\nTo enter His Holy Heaven, He demands us all to repent of our sins and turn from our wicked ways. Thru out the pages of Biblical History until now, Jesus Christ demands repentance of our sins. He is coming any day for His Biblical prepared people\nto rapture them out of this evil world then all hell will break loose upon all who are left behind. \nDo you realize God is not slack concerning His return, but He said it's not His will that any perish but that all come to repentance.  Are you aware all the signs of His prior warnings are being broadcast daily? Multitudes, Multitudes are in the valley of decision.  God likens His coming unto a woman about to birth a child.... we know she is expecting and will deliver a child. The process of development goes into stages of time and events, once everything is developed and in place dramatic changes occur frequent and intense. \nGod always warns prior to His wraths and Judgments.  God has always, and will always have a man or woman to warn the people.  Moses down thru the Apostle Peter ( Peter being the 1st New Testament Preacher ) Acts 2: 38- 40 told the people what to do to be saved from their sins ( Acts 2:38 )  He said Repent , everyone of you and be Baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holyghost, for the promise is to you and to your children and as many far off as the Lord God will call.  Those who believed were baptized... and the Church was added to daily. Acts 4:12... Ephesians 4:5 ... Acts Chapt. 19 \nJohn 3: 3-5.... Jesus says you must be born again to enter the Kingdom of God. He says you must be born of the water and the Spirit. Peter ( the 1 st New Testament Preacher ) told the people what to do to be forgiven of their sins. He commanded all to repent of their sins and be Baptized in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISIION OF THEIR SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLYGHOST, FOR THE PROMISE IS TO YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND TO AS MANY FAR OFF AS THE LORD GOD WILL CALL.\nDeuteronomy Chapt. 30: 11- 20\nGod is saying, This commandment which He is giving is not mysterious, the word is very near you. God is saying, See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil. In that, I command you today to love the Lord your God .  Walk in His ways, that you might live and be blessed, but if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, He says He announces to you this day,\nyou shall surely perish.  God says , He calls Heaven and Earth as witnesses against you that He has set before you \"LIFE\" or \" DEATH\" blessing and cursing :  Therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.  That you may love the Lord your God and cling to Him, Obey His voice. ( His word ) \nFrom Moses to Revelation....\nGod is pleading to all of us to \"REPENT\" of our sins and call upon Him \"before\" it's too late. There is Salvation in no other name... Only in Jesus Christ. He is the Way, Truth, and Life. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He changes not. Infant Baptism IS NOT BIBLICAL.  Revelation 3: 3 \nRemember therefore how you have received and heard: Hold fast\nand repent.  Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you. God's word and warnings are for us all .

I'm 18 years old and I'm looking for any available gigs or bands needing help. My primary instrument is the electric guitar. However, I also play the acoustic guitar and bass. I also sing and have originals that I have written. I'm very influenced by the blues and play blues rock, R&B, funk, classic rock, and a bit of jazz. My instagram is @drivasmusic if you want to check me out.

We help people produce projects from concept through recording and mastering to CD artwork design and duplication. We have a large library of samples and sound effects for film and video work and we do voice overs and soundtrack scoring as well every day.  Prices range from $60-$90/hr with an engineer and $40-$55/hr without an engineer included.  There are no extra fees required. All three studios have identical computers, software, plug-ins, mics, preamps and compressors, and monitors. Rates vary due to room size, room capability and engineer. \nLive room for all vocals and drums with extreme bass trapping and totally silent air conditioning.  Translation-we are recording stunningly punchy and tight drums with cymbals lower in the mix than in normal bright rooms.  The Sound of the 60's 70's and 80's is back!  We have two amp iso rooms specifically for guitar amplifiers. Room acoustics totally redesigned/rebuilt.  Tightest sound in town now.\n\n-At Mercy Sound, you always record on simply the best equipment ever made- BAR NONE We record using Neumann U87 and U47 and AKG C12 mics through vintage Neve 1073s, Retro, Cranesong, Universal Audio, API, Inward Connections, etc, etc equipment into ProTools Accel TDM, Avid HD IO for recording, editing and mixing. We monitor through NS-10s,  ADAM and Legacy Audio mastering monitors for clarity, translation and power.
