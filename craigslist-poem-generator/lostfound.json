Satan has one purpose , to kill, steal, and destroy. He is a master deceiver and father of lies.\n\nThis world is intoxicated with lust of the eye, drunkenness, lust of the flesh, greed, adultery, fornication,homosexuality, porn, sexual perversion of every sort.\n\nCorruption and Wickedness in high places has created a Godless society . \n\n ( Prisons are over flooded because Prayer, Jesus, and the Bible is rejected in Schools,  etc. )\n\n\nRebellion against God's word is sin, and sin causes Spiritual ignorance and Spiritual blindness leading to eternal Spiritual damnation / death.\n\nGOD IS A HOLY GOD:\nTo enter His Holy Heaven, He demands us all to repent of our sins and turn from our wicked ways.\n\nThru out the pages of Biblical History until now, Jesus Christ demands repentance of our sins. He is coming any day for His Biblical prepared people\nto rapture them out of this evil world then all hell will break loose upon all who are left behind. \nDo you realize God is not slack concerning His return, but He said it's not His will that any perish but that all come to repentance. \n\nAre you aware all the signs of His prior warnings are being broadcast daily?\n\nMultitudes, Multitudes are in the valley of decision. \n\nGod likens His coming unto a woman about to birth a child.... we know she is expecting and will deliver a child. The process of development goes into stages of time and events, once everything is developed and in place dramatic changes occur frequent and intense. \nGod always warns prior to His wraths and Judgments. \n\nGod has always, and will always have a man or woman to warn the people. \n\nMoses down thru the Apostle Peter ( Peter being the 1st New Testament Preacher ) Acts 2: 38- 40\n\n\ntold the people what to do to be saved from their sins ( Acts 2:38 ) \n\nHe said Repent , everyone of you and be Baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holyghost, for the promise is to you and to your children and as many far off as the Lord God will call. \n\nThose who believed were baptized... and the Church was added to daily. Acts 4:12... Ephesians 4:5 ... Acts Chapt. 19 \nJohn 3: 3-5.... Jesus says you must be born again to enter the Kingdom of God. He says you must be born of the water and the Spirit.\n\nPeter ( the 1 st New Testament Preacher ) told the people what to do to be forgiven of their sins. He commanded all to repent of their sins and be Baptized in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISIION OF THEIR SINS AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLYGHOST, FOR THE PROMISE IS TO YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND TO AS MANY FAR OFF AS THE LORD GOD WILL CALL.\nDeuteronomy Chapt. 30: 11- 20\nGod is saying, This commandment which He is giving is not mysterious, the word is very near you.\n\nGod is saying, See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.\nIn that, I command you today to love the Lord your God . \n\nWalk in His ways, that you might live and be blessed, but if your heart turns away so that you do not hear, He says He announces to you this day,\nyou shall surely perish. \n\nGod says , He calls Heaven and Earth as witnesses against you that He has set before you \"LIFE\" or \" DEATH\" blessing and cursing : \n\ntherefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live. \n\nThat you may love the Lord your God and cling to Him, Obey His voice. ( His word ) \nFrom Moses to Revelation....\nGod is pleading to all of us to \"REPENT\" of our sins and call upon Him \"before\" it's too late.\n\nThere is Salvation in no other name... Only in Jesus Christ. He is the Way, Truth, and Life. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He changes not.\n\nInfant Baptism IS NOT BIBLICAL. \n\nRevelation 3: 3 \nRemember therefore how you have received and heard: Hold fast\nand repent. \n\nTherefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.\n\n\nGod's word and warnings are for us all .

He OR SHE starts dressing better. According to divorce lawyer Marilyn Stowe, this is still a sign you should look out for. Did he suddenly morph from flannel and dirty boots to smart suits and shiny loafers? I'd add in wearing cologne all of a sudden, or changing the cologne he always wears to something new. Could be a sign the mistress gave him a bottle that she likes better.\n\n2. Guarding the cellphone. This is one I've heard a lot in my girlfriend circles -- he suddenly starts sleeping with the cellphone by his bedside, or bringing it into the shower with him. He may turn it off when you're together and say he doesn't want to be disturbed while he's with you -- but he really doesn't want to risk her texting or calling while you're there. If he won't even let you touch his phone, sumpthin' up.\n\n3. Password protecting everything. In this day and age, it's prudent to password protect your phone, but it can also be a sign if he suddenly starts doing it when he never cared before. Or he refuses to give you the password.\n\n4. He or she takes out new credit cards in his name. According to Stowe, this is a sign that he's spending money on the new flame -- especially if the bills go to another address or he has them delivered online only.\n\n5. He or she begins making hurtful remarks about you. Picking fights all of a sudden is a classic ploy -- this way if he ever gets caught, he can blame it on you and say you two were always fighting!\n\n6. He or she begins to drop a female or male name into his conversations. I've heard this one before, that a guy having an affair will start bringing up a certain woman all of the time. Apparently it gives him an adrenaline rush to feel like he can talk about her and get away with it. I'd also add avoiding talking about a certain woman -- say he starts working on a project with a woman but he NEVER mentions her. That's weird if he's spending a lot of time with her.\n\n7. Talking about how \"ugly\" or \"horrible\" a certain woman is. This is one I've seen a few times -- a guy tries to cover up his attraction to a certain woman by slagging her off every chance he gets.\n\n8. He suggests separate holidays. According to Stowe, this is a clear sign he wants you out of town.\n\n9. Doesn't want sex. He may not reject you, but he'll go along with your rejections where he may have previously fought them. Now it's like, \"Sure, let's watch a movie instead. Noooo problem.\"\n\n10. Social media. I'm simply amazed at how many men forget that their wife or girlfriend is on their Facebook and yet they will flirt or even \"check in\" with another woman also on his Facebook. Must think women are blind!\nWhile these are fairly \"classic\" signs, I've also seen and experienced the complete opposite. I know one husband who was doing basically all of the above -- but after much investigating, his wife couldn't find any evidence of him having an affair. And I've been in a situation where a guy was doing none of the above -- but was.\nSuch is life. It's always a conundrum.

Perhaps it is so you would have an extra one to donate and save a life! \n- Dr. Stuart Greenstein, Kidney Transplant Surgeon, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY \n\n\n\"We are born with approximately 4-5 times the kidney function that we need, to be healthy and stay off of dialyisis- to not have kidney failure. So by donating one of your kidneys, you are still left with with 2-3 times the amount of kidney function that you need to be healthy and lead a normal life\" \nJoseph Del Pizzo. Vice Chairman, Department of Urology, Associate Professor of Urology and Transplantation Surgery , Weill Cornell Medical College - New York, NY\n\n\n\"Kidney donation is a relatively safe operation, and many donors will never feel the loss of their second kidney. So giving up a kidney causes no disadvantage to your long-term health. In fact, studies have shown, that kidney donors actually live longer than the general population - because donors come from a pool of people in good health\"\n- Dr. Michael Edye, former Adjunct Associate Professor of surgery, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY\n\n\n\"Very Safe Operation\"\n- Dr. Jay Levine, General Surgeon, St., Mary's Health Care, West Michigan, MI \n\n\n\"Those who donate a kidney have an \"extremely low\" risk of developing kidney failure in their remaining organ, U.S. researchers. \"It's certainly safer than many other things we choose to do in our lives,\" -- Dr. Dorry Segev, transplant surgeon at John Hopkins For the article - http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90782/8533487.html\n\n\n\"Once people have recuperated from the surgery -- they should be 100% completely normal - no special diet, no limitation on their exercises , no special medications.\" -- Dr. Lloyd Ratner, Director, Renal and Pancreatic Transplant Program, surgeon -- NY Presbytarian -- Columbia Medical Center\n\n\"There's a lot of misconceptions about kidney donation and a lot of fear. But if people take the time to get the facts, they find out the risks are very minimal. People are born with two kidneys. You only lneed one.\" \n- Michelle Winsor, Kidney Transplant Coordinator, Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, CA\n\n\nQUOTES FROM PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DONATED A KIDNEY: \n\n\n\"People always ask me why I donated my kidney - and I always respond with, why wouldn't I donate a kidney? I had 41 surgeries in my life and the kidney donation was the easiest surgery of them all\" - John Feal, Long Island, NY - 9/11 responder, who donated a kidney to a stranger. (I know this wonderful man. He donated a kidney, despite his foot was crushed while helping to remove debris from the twin towers wreckage. And yet, after that he went on and donated a kidney, and is doing great! He has an organization to help other 9/11 First Responders: http://www.fealgoodfoundation.com.)\n\n\"I have gained so much more then I gave through donating a kidney\" -- Marisa Hester, Alabama\n\n\"There is no greater feeling than knowing you brought life to another human being. It has truly been an amazing experience that ranks right up there with the birth of my 9 children. If I could, I would do it again tomorrow.\" - Rabbi Ephraim Simon, Chabad of Teaneck, NJ\n\n\"Donating a kidney to a woman I had never met was the greatest experience of my life. To give for the pure sake of giving brings the deepest joy imaginable. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity that changed my life in every way\" - Lori Palatnik, Silver Springs, Maryland,\n\nI think this is the right thing to do. I don't think anyone should fear it . They wouldn't allow you to do this if you weren't healthy enough' - Larry Seidman, New Jersey \n\nIt was a bittersweet moment, one I would not trade for anything in the world -- because this year for Chanukah, I gave the gift of life.\" -- Rabbi Ari Sytner, New Jersey\n\n\"Giving a kidney was one of the highlights of my life. I learned so much about myself in such a short time. Rarely do we see the fruit of our labor so quickly, yet I helped save another persons life and improved the quality of their life immediately - Rabbi Steve Moskowitz, Long Island, NY\n\n\"The reason why G-d gave me two kidneys, was so that I could donate one\" -- Mordechai Hursarsky Brooklyn, NY\n\n\"As a result of my kidney donation, I feel richer than Donald Trump and Bill Gates combined!\" - David Koster, Brooklyn, NY\n\n\n\nI'm in absolute awe that I was able to participate with Hashem's help in prolonging and saving a life\" - Marci Rapp, Israel\n\n\"My swimming has improved since donating and my fitness level has not deteriorated.\"\n- Sopha Goode, Washington\n\nI felt great and recall thinking I would do it all over again tomorrow. This journey was probably the most meaningful experience in my life. -- Angela Stimpson\n\nIt's the best thing that has ever happened to me. More people need to know that it will change their lives for the better.\" -- Winnie Liu\n\nIf only people knew how amazing it will make you feel. I mean, i know I helped save a life, but it has changed me. Just an unexplainable experience. Has brought me closer to G-d. Just simply amazing.\n- Aimee Wheeler Bultemeier\n\n\"No need to worry when donating a kidney. It's the biggest blessing that could be.\"\n- Mordichai Shuchat\n\n\n\"Giving a kidney was no big deal...I've had dental treatment that was worse\" \n- Paul Dixon \n(Quote taken from this article I found on the internet: http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/meet-merseyside-man-paul-dixon-5073526)\n\n\n\"I would love to do more to help with kidney donation! I actually had a level of depression set in after the donation because I wish I could do it again! It was the BEST day of my life! It is hard to explain to someone who hasn't been through the experience just how awesome the feeling is. My brother and I are celebrating 4 years next week of sharing organs. Not a better feeling in the world..... \"\n-- Melissa Mandracchia, Burlington, MA.\n\n\"The best decision I have ever made with no regrets.There is nothing more valuable than the gift of life.\"\n- Laura Friedberg, Stanford, CT.\n\n10001    ","title":"Ed Kranepool, METS, desperately needs help!
