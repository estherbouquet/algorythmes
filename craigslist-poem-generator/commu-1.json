I purchased several pieces of furniture from THE BEARDED FURNITURE SALESMAN'S STORE IN CO-OP CITY, IN THE BRONX, AND HAD IT ALL DELIVERED IN LATE DECEMBER OF 2017.  On January 4th, I went back down to the store and spoke to my salesman, who put me on the phone with their \"CUSTOMER CARE\" department, REGARDING MULTIPLE CRACKS IN THE WOOD of the WALL UNIT I purchased (FIRST 3 PHOTOS BELOW).  They took all my info and told me they would be sending me an email, so I could attach pictures of the damage.   TEN DAYS LATER, I WENT BACK TO THE CO-OP CITY STORE AND LET THEM KNOW I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM \"CUSTOMER CARE\" AT ALL.\nFrom that point on, it took a) A RETURN RECEIPT LETTER, WITH PICTURES, TO THE CEO, WHICH WAS NOT RESPONDED TO.  b) FILING COMPLAINTS WITH BOTH THE NYS AND CONNECTICUT BETTER BUSINESS BUREAUS AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND  c) FILING A SMALL CLAIMS LAWSUIT IN BRONX COUNTY, AGAINST THE BEARDED SALES MAN'S DISCOUNT FURNITURE COMPANY .\nFinally, MARCH 16,2018 MORE THAN 2 ½ MONTHS AFTER MY ORIGINAL COMPLAINT, I was delivered a replacement wall unit, which cost me an additional $108.00 because the new unit was a more expensive model.  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE NEW UNIT HAD A PIECE OF WOOD CHIPPED OFF THE BOTTOM IN THE CORNER (PHOTO BELOW).  BY THIS TIME, I WAS NOT ABOUT TO COMPLAIN TO THE STORE AGAIN BECAUSE AT MY AGE I MAY NOT LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER REPLACEMENT.\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, AT THE BEARDED SALESMAN'S DISCOUNT FURNITURE STORE, THE PRICES ARE DISCOUNTED, THE QUALITY IS DEEPLY DISCOUNTED AND THE \"CUSTOMER CARE\" DEPARTMENT 'S SLOGAN IS ......WE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS.

Kurt loves nothing more than an opportunity to entertain his audiences, and welcomes all song requests.

From the booking through the planning to the day of the ceremony Kurt kept in great communication, was very willing to work with our requests, went out of his way to understand and provide exactly what we were looking for. Kurt learned two new songs for our ceremony - all we had to do was tell him the songs and he sang them perfectly. He also played and sang other songs as guests were arriving and set a great tone. And he is an all around nice and kind guy to work with. You can totally trust Kurt to do a great job!\n- Ed F  Brooklyn Gardens\n\nWhat an AMAZING talent! Kurt is professional, responsive and incredibly gifted artist. He travelled from Queens up to Dutchess county to help me celebrate my 50th birthday. How lucky was I to find him on Gigimasters website? My family and friends throughly enjoyed listening to Kurt perform. He was the icing on the cake at my birthday celebration. I would highly reccomend him for your next gathering. Someday, I hope to hear Kurt Borst's name over the radio. He is Absolutely the BEST!\nReview by Donna P. FROM LAGRANGEVILLE, NY\n\nKurt was awesome. So talented and so easy to work with! I could not have asked for a better musician for my fundraiser. I can't wait to book him for another event.\n-Katie P, West Babylon, NY\n\n\"If you need live music for your event, Kurt is your guy! Our guests could not stop talking about how talented he is, and exceptionally sounding his performance was! His communication with us was not only timely, but accommodating throughout the entire process. We briefly chatted with him in person on our wedding day too, and he was very friendly, humble and happy to be there. Highly recommend Kurt! Thank you, Kurt!\"\n- Lauren R\n\n\"Kurt played the music for our ceremony and cocktail hour. He was absolutely amazing! We heard him play at our friends' wedding and knew instantly that we wanted him at ours. He was very professional and so accomadating.

From the booking through the planning to the day of the ceremony Kurt kept in great communication, was very willing to work with our requests, went out of his way to understand and provide exactly what we were looking for. Kurt learned two new songs for our ceremony - all we had to do was tell him the songs and he sang them perfectly. He also played and sang other songs as guests were arriving and set a great tone. And he is an all around nice and kind guy to work with. You can totally trust Kurt to do a great job!\n- Ed F  Brooklyn Gardens\n\nWhat an AMAZING talent! Kurt is professional, responsive and incredibly gifted artist. He travelled from Queens up to Dutchess county to help me celebrate my 50th birthday. How lucky was I to find him on Gigimasters website? My family and friends throughly enjoyed listening to Kurt perform. He was the icing on the cake at my birthday celebration. I would highly reccomend him for your next gathering. Someday, I hope to hear Kurt Borst's name over the radio. He is Absolutely the BEST!\nReview by Donna P.

I purchased several pieces of furniture from THE BEARDED FURNITURE SALESMAN'S STORE IN CO-OP CITY, IN THE BRONX, AND HAD IT ALL DELIVERED IN LATE DECEMBER OF 2017.  On January 4th, I went back down to the store and spoke to my salesman, who put me on the phone with their \"CUSTOMER CARE\" department, REGARDING MULTIPLE CRACKS IN THE WOOD of the WALL UNIT I purchased (FIRST 3 PHOTOS BELOW).  They took all my info and told me they would be sending me an email, so I could attach pictures of the damage.   TEN DAYS LATER, I WENT BACK TO THE CO-OP CITY STORE AND LET THEM KNOW I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM \"CUSTOMER CARE\" AT ALL.\nFrom that point on, it took a) A RETURN RECEIPT LETTER, WITH PICTURES, TO THE CEO, WHICH WAS NOT RESPONDED TO.  b) FILING COMPLAINTS WITH BOTH THE NYS AND CONNECTICUT BETTER BUSINESS BUREAUS AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND  c) FILING A SMALL CLAIMS LAWSUIT IN BRONX COUNTY, AGAINST THE BEARDED SALES MAN'S DISCOUNT FURNITURE COMPANY .\nFinally, MARCH 16,2018 MORE THAN 2 ½ MONTHS AFTER MY ORIGINAL COMPLAINT, I was delivered a replacement wall unit, which cost me an additional $108.00 because the new unit was a more expensive model.  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE NEW UNIT HAD A PIECE OF WOOD CHIPPED OFF THE BOTTOM IN THE CORNER (PHOTO BELOW).  BY THIS TIME, I WAS NOT ABOUT TO COMPLAIN TO THE STORE AGAIN BECAUSE AT MY AGE I MAY NOT LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER REPLACEMENT.\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, AT THE BEARDED SALESMAN'S DISCOUNT FURNITURE STORE, THE PRICES ARE DISCOUNTED, THE QUALITY IS DEEPLY DISCOUNTED AND THE \"CUSTOMER CARE\" DEPARTMENT 'S SLOGAN IS ......WE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, PAY A LITTLE MORE MONEY AT ANOTHER FURNITURE STORE AND GET THE QUALITY AND SERVICE YOU DESERVE AS A CUSTOMER.\n\n    ","title":"**BEWARE OF THE BEARDED FURNITURE SALESMAN**","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/rnr/d/beware-of-the-bearded/6551798619.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWE HAVE THE SUMMER TIME SONG OF 2018.

Due to a limited space. The wife is forcing me to get rid of one of my dogs and unfortunately it brings a tear to my eye to know that this beautiful girl is the one I have to get rid of. She's a sweet and shy little girl. I came from California (just got out of military). And brought this girl with me. She is an American bully and was within an hour of being euthanized. I couldn't let that happen so I took her in. She did great with my other dog. He's really helped her come out of her shell. But again sadly I can't have her for much longer if I could I would keep her. Asking 150 Rehoming fee which is just what I paid for at the kill shelter in California. She is micro chipped and will come with her cage and food bowl. Need her gone ASAP. I AM WILLING TO KEEP IN CONTACT TO KNOW HOW MY SWEET GIRL IS DOING    ","title":"Beautiful American bully 3 years old","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/pet/d/beautiful-american-bully-3/6551875367.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nBest deals and destinations\nSave time on book the traveling vacations.\nNew Credit services  show contact info\n\n150 28 Hillside Ave Jamaica NY 11432\n Call now  show contact info\n.

These are common to oligarchy and tyranny.\n-- Aristotle\n\n\nAlthough it is extremely unlikely that the fear of governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the 2nd amendment, will ever be a major danger to our Nation, the amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic military-civilian relationship, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason I believe the 2nd Amendment will always be important. -- John F. Kennedy\n\n\nAmong the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.\n-- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\n\n\nThere are no dangerous weapons. There are only dangerous men.\n-- Robert Heinlein\n\n\nAmericans have the will to resist because you have weapons. If you don't have a gun, freedom of speech has no power.\n-- Yoshimi Ishikawa\n\n\n.....as Americans, we will not give up a single right guaranteed under the Constitution. The history of unpunished violence against our people clearly indicates that we must be prepared to defend ourselves or we will continue to be a defenseless people.....\n- Malcolm X\n\n\n\nAmong other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised.\n-- Niccolo Machiavelli\n\n\n\nPeace to NYC.

While we can blame the neocons, and you would be right as well, the cause  of this is Statism; and this is what Leftists support and defend i.e. Statism. Conservatives (not neocons) hate Statism.\n\nThe authoritarian/victim dynamic is what keeps people feeling like they are in a prison. The answer to this dilemma that has been created precisely by Statism (and Collectivism), or State profit; is to embody non-duality.\n\nThat is to move toward reality by breaking your mind and body [up and] out of the dualistic fear based prison Matrix of the State. You do this, and remain in this state, and you will not only be free, but you will be the new and 'dominant species on the planet' here to reclaim your birthright in Liberty.\n\nThis is the embodiment of Liberty (Individual Liberty).

These are common to oligarchy and tyranny.\n-- Aristotle\n\n\nAlthough it is extremely unlikely that the fear of governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the 2nd amendment, will ever be a major danger to our Nation, the amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic military-civilian relationship, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason I believe the 2nd Amendment will always be important. -- John F. Kennedy\n\n\nAmong the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.\n-- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\n\n\nThere are no dangerous weapons. There are only dangerous men.\n-- Robert Heinlein\n\n\nAmericans have the will to resist because you have weapons. If you don't have a gun, freedom of speech has no power.\n-- Yoshimi Ishikawa\n\n\n.....as Americans, we will not give up a single right guaranteed under the Constitution. The history of unpunished violence against our people clearly indicates that we must be prepared to defend ourselves or we will continue to be a defenseless people.....\n- Malcolm X\n\n\n\nAmong other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised.\n-- Niccolo Machiavelli\n\n\n\nPeace to NYC.

When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\"\n\n\n\nLeftism has turned this country into a nightmare for most people. While we can blame the neocons, and you would be right as well, the cause  of this is Statism; and this is what Leftists support and defend i.e. Statism. Conservatives (not neocons) hate Statism.\n\nThe authoritarian/victim dynamic is what keeps people feeling like they are in a prison. The answer to this dilemma that has been created precisely by Statism (and Collectivism), or State profit; is to embody non-duality.\n\nThat is to move toward reality by breaking your mind and body [up and] out of the dualistic fear based prison Matrix of the State. You do this, and remain in this state, and you will not only be free, but you will be the new and 'dominant species on the planet' here to reclaim your birthright in Liberty.\n\nThis is the embodiment of Liberty (Individual Liberty).

(Obviously, this would probably apply to musicians/bands if they're not currently gigging, they don't gig that often, they're in-between bands, the band just broke up, they haven't been playing in awhile, etc. Or, maybe they do this on a regular, ongoing basis.) This would also generally include a need for transportation for the equipment.\n\nWhat would the use be for, why am I running this ad? I'm a drummer with a kit, and that's it, no other equipment, and currently no car, but I have a DIY mentality. On very rare occasions I'd want to put together a live music event with a few bands, in a public facility for example, but, I would need all the necessary equipment. In addition, on a much less involved basis, if I can arrange with a bar owner/club owner to book a band I play with on an ongoing basis (one night a week for a couple months, for example), I would probably need a PA, along with microphones and stands. \n\nIn essence, what I'm looking for are REASONABLE rates, working with reliable people. (I've gotta' figure that this sort of arrangement would work for some people.) (And, oh yeah, with at least one facility I'm thinking of, a VERY large dolly would also come in handy!!!) (And, if you don't necessarily have the transportation (van, small truck, etc.), then I would also throw in the vehicle rental fees as well,) \n\nAnd if anyone out there is basically in the same boat as me, hey, I'd be open to hear from you, as far as your experiences, and there'd also be the possibility of potentially working together on projects in the future.\n\nThanks\n\n\n    ","title":"Looking for a very occasional \"rental\" of music equipment, with trans.","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/muc/d/looking-for-very-occasional/6534472435.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWe have a newly created rock and roll band. My intent was to put together a straight-up rock and roll band, along the lines of Joan Jett, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, the Smithereens, Springsteen, etc. (Definitely NOT hard rock or heavy metal or death metal or shoegaze.) I'm putting together a show at Tompkins Square Park on Sunday, May 13 (Mother's Day), 1 pm till 5 pm, and this band will be the opening and closing band. We're starting off with covers because that's the easiest and quickest way to go, but we will then transition to more and more originals as time goes on. I sublet a rehearsal room in the Music Building on 8 Avenue. \n\nFor the show, we'll be doing roughly five or six Tom Petty songs, Behind the Wall of Sleep by the Smithereens, Keep on Rockin' in the Free World by Neil, What's so Funny 'Bout Peace, Love and Understanding by Nick Lowe (Elvis C.), Rebel Rebel by Bowie and one or two others. \n\nThe band members are generally pretty well road-tested. As soon as we're ready, besides the May 13 show, we'd be looking to get the band out to start gigging. I would note however that there's no money expected in the near-term at all, sorry!! I'd also note that I'm currently in one other band, and though we're currently only very lightly gigging, I am dedicated to that group, but I will also be dedicated to this group as well. And lastly, the age range in this group varies widely, so if you're looking for a bunch of 20 year-olds to hang out with and party, well, we're probably not for you - we're here to work. \n\nAND, A QUICK NOTE - Hey, if you're unsure about actually JOINING this group, but, you have a couple months of a bit of free time to spare, we could use even a temporary singer, as long you're willing to work at it at least just a bit!!!\n\nTHANKS, I appreciate it!!\n\nAnd, by the way, the May 13 show is going to be a great show and a lot of fun, I've booked some very good bands on the bill. My next show like this is going to be Saturday, October 13, again at Tompkins Square Park.

At his foster home, he mostly hid all day for 6 months, not letting anyone pet or approach him. That being said, he recently warmed up and is now letting the caretaker pet him and pick him up a lot. He needs to be rehomed as his owner moved into a housing situation that doesn't allow pets. He's 2.5 years old, neutered , litter box trained. He was more affectionate with his former owner, and used to rub against her leg sometimes.\n\n********************************************************************************************************\nMittens and Tigger come from the same home, but separate homes are fine.

She's 13 years old, neutered/vaccinated.\nMittens is a sweet chatterbox who craves companionship and loves to be the center of attention. Although she enjoys playing huntress, she is still a lap cat at heart. She likes to shower friends with affection, softly butting her head into you, or extending a paw out to hold hands. She is sly and intelligent; one of her many tricks is to come visit when whistled to. Mittens is friendly and welcoming to new faces but may need some time to adjust around existing animal companions or young children.\n\nTigger is a brown tabby, 9 years old, neutered/vaccinated.\nTigger is a pure lap cat who loves to spend lazy days snuggled up with his owner. One of his favorite past-times is to play hide and seek, meekly meowing and giving chase in search for his companions. He enjoys playing fetch but sometimes forgets the rules. Above all he enjoys to dig himself into a blanket or under your hands and snooze. Tigger is timid at first, but a loyal companion when he gets comfortable. Tigger has a strong flight response to erratic behavior and noises, so would fit best in a calm home.\n\nMacho, Tigee and Allie all come from the same home, however, separate homes are fine. They need to be rehomed as their owner, an elderly woman, passed away. Her daughter cannot keep them. All are neutered/vaccinated. \n\nMacho is mostly white with some grey splotches. He's 8 years old and he is deaf, and a bit aggressive. He is mostly friendly but he can bite and hit sometimes. \n\nTigee is a tan tabby cat, 5 years old, female. She's very friendly and affectionate and loves turkey and treats.\n\nAllie is 13, friendly, likes to be petted, but not on her belly or back. She loves tuna fish.

A mental defect that turns them conservative? You threatened to respond to the subject of Hillary and Iran and paying off criminal defense lawyers and charging his own security detail $130, 000 A MONTH, didntcha? So what happened? Don't you read your own shit? Nothing in your drivel about Hillary, or Iran, or paying off criminal defense lawyers, or charging his own security detail $130, 000 a month. WTF???\n\nBut OK, it appears that between finishing your first paragraph and starting a second one, you forgot WTF you are supposed to be bitching about. Happens to conservatards all the time.\n\nSo Trump keeps everything he charges the government ($ 130,000 A MONTH just for the security quarters in Trump Tower), and donates  his salary ($30,000 a month)... you sure you want to brag about that? BTW, Obama donated $1 million while he's been in office, which makes moocher Obozo way ahead of  the orange shitgibbon so far. Maybe you want to brag about this instead?\n\nAnd could you be a bit more generic about what liberals start? Did they start Russia? Did they start executive overrreach? Did they start paying off hookers? Did they start unfair press? I was under the impression that Nixon \"started\" Russia with \"detente\" and all the nuclear arms agreements. And I thought it was Nixon who said \"if the President did it, it is not illegal\". Ok, so JFK started paying off hookers, but it wasn't until Denny Hastert that politicians started paying off underaged boys. And just to give you a fucking clue, it was Randolph Hearst, hardly a liberal, who started unfair press. \n\n...Don't you wish you just stuck with the original thread and were destroyed on just one subject rather than sticking your ignorant neck out and enduring humiliation on a whole bunch of subjects that you yourself brought up?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRE: If he gave anything to Iran as Hillary did, he would be giving them exactly jack shit.\nWould you conservatards like Hillary more if she, like Trump, used your political contributions to pay off his criminal defense lawyers? Or charged the Secret Service exorbitant rent in a building he owns on Fifth Avenue?\n\nHEY LIBTURDS...GOOGLE \"TRUMP DONATES SALARY\"...see if moocher Obozo did the same ha ha\n\nNotice Liberals always complain about things they start. Example Russians, example executive over-reach (obozo), example paying off hookers [clinton], unfair press (darn near owned CNN),\n\n\nthe RNC money with which Trump is paying for his legal defense is available for him to use thanks to the work of Clinton's campaign lawyer, Marc Elias. Elias played a key role in negotiating the expansion of campaign contribution limits for the political parties in 2014. Based on reports from Politico and HuffPost, it was Elias who proposed the existence of an account that could cover nearly any legal expense.\n\nThat account was created under a deal between House Republicans and Senate Democrats to expand political party fundraising capabilities as part of the omnibus spending bill passed in December 2014.\n\n\"Not only were the Democrats involved, but Democrats spearheaded this,\" Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer with the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, told HuffPost.

RIGHT JOE ! You meaningless sponge !! BY FAR , you ARE WRONG again. You soak the rich homosexuals' money, to spew their false narrative with your recognition microphone, THEN try to convince honorable working family people that any two people who want to ' m a r r y ' - is nobodies business ? Why you phony sponging meaningless IMP ! A man and woman , was the definition of marriage LONG before these United States were ever thought of, and it is that NATURAL HOLY union, which produces the absolute MOST secure, healthy environment in which healthy children are raised and CONCEIVED. Every taxpayer and every soldier who supports and defends this nation or ANY nation are the product of heterosexual engagement. Working people ARE FAMILY LOVING PEOPLE, Joe, and for you to claim it is Okay by the working people of THIS nation if 2 homosexuals pervert the institution of marriage is a damned lie !! 31 times the issue was put on the ballot and all 31 times was voted down by clear headed , right minded voters. This is simply a stepping stone to suggesting to normal working peoples, healthy children that \"God made a mistake with them\", ... making this perverse suggestion before these little ones even know or understand what sex is or how they feel ! - which is simply the furthering of undermining the stability of this nation, in accordance with globalists agenda !! The family unit is the VERY FABRIC of this nation, and these money soaking democRATS pushing the perversion agenda is nothing more than them padding their own pockets, selling the security and future of our nation out to the highest bidder at the moment !!! Shame on you Biden! Had I had a Dad who stood for no more than what you represent, I TOO would have taken the opportunity for an honorable early exit, just to relieve myself of the shame he made me bear.\n\n    ","title":"re: Biden - meaningless , moral-less sponge !","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/pol/d/re-biden-meaningless-moral/6528422773.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nHey there!\nI'm a gigging/recording artist who is looking for a dynamic, finesse-type rock n roll drummer who is looking for an active outfit to dedicate time to. \n\nLooking for M/F/Other in the 25-32 year old range.
