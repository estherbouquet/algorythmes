During a night out in Park Slope last Saturday evening May 12, 2018, from approximately 10:30 PM to 12:15 AM, I dropped or otherwise misplaced my men's brown wallet with some credit cards, ID cards, in one of the following places: Freddy's; Skylark; a southbound B63 bus; a northbound green taxi hail; or anywhere around those places (on the ground on 5th Avenue, or in a flower bed on 6th Street, for example).

My passport fell out of my pocket between those 5 blocks and when I turned around to look for it, it was gone so I'm assuming somebody picked it up.

Dog ran out AND we are desperately looking for him.
After 6 days and 5 nights of searching, and the tremendous help from the neighbors, we caught Reese about 2 miles from home.
From that point, we were able to post flyers, hand out flyers and talk with people who lived near the area of where he had been seen last.

Hi there,


Tell me what color hat you were wearing.
Definitely regret not being bolder and missing what might have been an awesome connection.
I think you know I am interested, I mean, I glance over to you a handful of times, trying to give you the hint, like "hi :)".
You have dark-ish blond/brown hair.

I later seen you at Milbreae Avenue talking to a sheriff.

Totally forgot to give you my number, be great to see you again and talk more Philosophy and History...

this morning i tripped about 6 times on the sidewalk in front of mr. kiwis - each time i tripped i gained momentum and ended up falling on my face in the middle of the road.
I saw something special in you, but my stop came up before I could ask for your number.
I was waiting for a friend so I was not able to approach you.
Whatever you were asking, the answer's probably yes - hit me up with more details to confirm if you think this is you.
