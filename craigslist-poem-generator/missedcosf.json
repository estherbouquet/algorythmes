The car driving behind me barely left me enough room to parallel park and may have even almost backed in to the car behind them trying to give me room. I skillfully made the tight squeeze into the parking spot and I suggested that person \"give a little more room!\" for people trying to park as they drove by. \n\nYou: were parked in the spot directly in front of the spot I parked in. You must've witnessed this slight parking challenge while walking by and came up to me to offer the remaining 20 minutes on your parking meter as you were about to drive away. I'd been spending quite a bit of time thinking on kindness recently and expressed my gratitude for the kind act, saying \"it really made my day\" or, \"I really needed that today.\" You were already walking back to your car as I said this but turned on a dime when I said that and pulled a card out of your wallet and handed it to me. It was a quote that said, \"Don't worry - be happy.\"\n\nWell I HAD been mired in worry and fear off and on that day and for a couple days before. I quickly said, \"This is so serendipitous! I've been tripping and worrying all day. Thank you!!\" I think you smiled and drove off.\n\nAnd someone else immediately pulled into your parking spot with the 20 minutes on the meter as I sat in my car in shock and bewilderment. That 20 minutes on the meter was nothing compared to the kindness you showed when I was feeling especially stressed. That quote (by Meher Baba) was EXACTLY what I needed right at that moment.\n\nI went on with the errands I needed to run, still taken aback at what had happened. For some reason I was delayed on each of these errands but, instead of feeling impatient and annoyed (unfortunately often the norm for me), I was patient, confident that there were many lessons to be learned from my afternoon in Montclair. Because of this patience, I made more eye contact and smiles with passers by and engaged in more conversation than I usually do while interacting with people in the village. \n\nThe afternoon and interactions were blessings! Your kind gestures gave me a lot to focus on and when I have the \"attitude of gratitude,\" my day always seems to go better. \n\nThank you!
