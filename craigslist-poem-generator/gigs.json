Google \"allan andre poet\" or go to www.alandramarkman.com.\n\nMy third business is making original music. There's no reason to go into detail about this one, as it's much more common, and even worse on the business side.\n\nI need the assistance of someone who is also multi-talented, able to play roles like agent, producer, event person and/or marketer. The ideal person for this gig will believe fully in the depth and usefulness of my spiritual and creative powers. You will have some familiarity with spiritual and creative processes, including a daily meditation practice of your own...\n\nAND you will be willing to work by commission, tying your monetary success to mine. Your intuition and spiritual guidance will tell you that I am completely worth your while. I am not a hack or a pyramid schemer. Investing time and effort in my work will pay off energetically and financially.\n\nI know it's a lot to ask for, but I'm sure you're out there.\n\nRegards, Alandra.\n\nkeywords: starseed, pr, poetry, healing, meditation, social media, art, creativity, spirituality, contemplation, entertainer, party, event, insight, marketing, public relations, reference, booking    ","title":"Spiritually aware agent needed for healer and artist (by commission)","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/crg/d/spiritually-aware-agent/6601449836.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nLooking for 2 people with moving experience to move a two seat couch 4 blocks either tonight or tomorrow afternoon (10/29) around 5:30pm.

This is a paid position and will require you to take the script for a week, get to know it, find your voice, and then do a 2 hour recording session. The pay is negotiable and you will be in the credits and any film revenue will be shared equally among the cast (including you) for the life of the film. The film is about Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, the original \"Rebel Girl\" from 1906 and the film is about a speech she gave at the age of 16 in 1906. I'm looking for a father role (around 45, but anyone with a strong male voice 30-60 years old), a mother (same age range as father) and Gurley herself who is 16 but a voice range of 18-35 would work. I want people who are exceptional readers - really powerful, thoughtful, and must be able to do (or naturally possess) a strong Irish accent (turn of the century 20th) NY. \n\nI am the writer and director. This is a feature length narrative film. We are in final shooting stages now with actors. Once I have the voice over people lined up and we've narrated the film will be edited through July and in August we start submitting to festivals. I have a masters degree in fine art and have exhibited video projects nationally. This is my first feature film and it is a low budget film.\n\nThank you! I will be doing phone auditions FYI - so it'll be easy to audition. Please include a resume in your responses - ie: website, something where I can hear your work.

The video follows two friends abandoning a fancy dinner to explore the more fun side of NYC. It is shot by an incredible cinematographer in more of an artistic style than traditional pop video.\n\nScenes we need actors for:\n\nIce cream giveaway scene (likely 7PM to 8:15PM in East Village)\n\nActors will act as strangers surprised to receive free ice cream and treats from the video's leads. This is a fun scene and could incorporate dance, if that is your specialty. Casual dress.\n\n\nFine dining scene (from 11PM to 1AM in Upper East Side)\n\nActors will be seated as couples in a fine dining restaurant. They subtly react as the leads storm out of the restaurant. You will have food and wine. Actors will need to dress themselves, ideally in upscale looking clothing (blazer, dress, etc). Actors will need to stay until 1AM.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThis is unpaid, but will be an incredible addition to a reel and a fun experience. I'm glad to send both the song and the cinematographer's reel. \n\nIf interested, please let me know which scene you are submitting to. Please send photos and a reel, if you have one, though amateur actors are welcome as well. I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nC    ","title":"Actors/Actresses Needed for Pop Music Video - 6/3","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/tlg/d/actors-actresses-needed-for/6600752504.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nEEC is an internet marketing website seeking internet\nmarketing specialists to advertise campaigns on \nSocial Media and other e-commerce websites. \n\nFull training is provided!\nThis position is remote and pays on commission. \n\nDesired attributes: \nInnovation, Leadership, Action-Oriented, \nStrong Verbal & Written Communication Skills,\nAttention to detail and excellent Project Management Skills; \nAbility to manage multiple projects concurrently\n\n*If you are interested in joining our team, please follow the website below*\n\n\n http://rdtrck2.com/5ae569f82c822c5ae99e40ac?sub1=ChuckH    ","title":"Internet Marketers Wanted, Earn Autopilot Commissions","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/crg/d/internet-marketers-wanted/6600744945.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWELL KNOWN DJ IS SEEKING RELIABLE INDIVIDUALS TO WORK AS PART OF HIS ROAD CREW TEAM ON HIS ANNUAL SUMMER CAMP TOUR.\nWILL TRAIN TO SET-UP/BREAK DOWN...LOAD AND UNLOAD ALL SOUND AND A/V EQUIPMENT FOR EACH SHOW ON TOUR.\nYOU MUST BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 17- 25\n\nWE HAVE 4 MANDATORY TRAINING SESSIONS IN JUNE AT OUR HUNTINGTON LOCATION\n\nTOUR STARTS JULY 8TH AND ENDS AUGUST 17th.\nCURRENTLY THERE ARE 11 SHOWS BOOKED.\n\nWE ARE ON THE ROAD ACCORDING TO THE TOUR SCHEDULE \nWE TRAVEL DOING SHOWS AT DIFFERENT SUMMER CAMPS FROM MAINE TO MARYLAND.\nWE MAY BE ON THE ROAD FOR UP TO 10 DAYS OR 3 DAYS AT A TIME.\n \nALL EXPENSES PAID..INCLUDING ROOM AND BOARD\nYOU MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL SHOWS AND BE ABLE TO COMMIT TO THE ENTIRE TOUR SCHEDULE !\n\nPREFERABLY YOU MUST LIVE IN EITHER NASSAU OR SUFFOLK COUNTY AND HAVE A CAR TO GET TO OUR LOAD IN LOCATION. \n\nYOU MUST HAVE A CLEAN DRIVERS LICENSE, BE DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE AND A NON SMOKER !\n\nMINIMUM TOTAL TOUR SALARY $1100.00\n\nINTERESTED INDIVIDUALS SHOULD EMAIL THEIR PICTURE AND PHONE FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE    ","title":"Road Crew/Tech Crew for Summer Camp Tour","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/cwg/d/road-crew-tech-crew-for/6600737698.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nLooking to hire for several different labor jobs (Moving, Construction, Repair).

And we've come extremely close several times in the past (well documented). See for example, \"The Man Who Saved the World\" obituary on Lt Col Petrov and also a film on the same. So many other near misses. Really quite miraculous we are still here.\nRecent Tedx talk as well (Denver), not to mention great recent interviews with Ellsberg on YouTube.\n\nMission:\n1) To help me find the contact info and get the attention of major players (thought leaders, the CIA and Pentagon, and large donors) concerned with the likelihood of nuclear war, and then \n2) To then expose them to the incredible prescience of a 60 minute documentary (was aired on most major market PBS stations) I made long ago that explains how we could blunder into an inadvertent nuclear war.

Pay $100/month with opportunity for more.\n\nHello! I am an author who recently received my First mainstream book deal with a traditional publisher. I have previously self published 6 books, which I did mainly as a proof of concept, not necessarily to market and sell. But with this book deal, I know the importance of a good publicist. If this offer is not of interest, would love to receive any publicity tips or article, videos or resources that might be valuable for an author. Ideally, I am seeking a publicist that is looking to build their clientele, or established firm that can take on promising client. \n\nI have a brief plan and some ideas but I'm looking for a publicist that can help me develop an enhanced marketing plan to strengthen my platform and obtain print, blog or other promotion/branding opportunities. Also, I'm seeking paid speaking engagements. I am approached 2-4 times per year so I know there is a market for me to expand in certain cities and among certain audiences.\n\nI don't have a budget to pay at this time, so what I am hoping for is someone willing to take me on in a similar financial way as my literary agent but the difference would be you'd take 10 percent cut of my first quarter royalty check. And I would also pay $100 every month for the next 6 months, starting in June. Then starting in January I will be working with the publisher's publicist and then hope to have a budget for you of $300 (as an advance) every month for 12 months that'd be deducted from your 10 percent payment of my speaking engagements and royalties throughout 2019. Book will released in September 2019. \n\nIF INTERESTED:\nPlease send me brief blurb about your self and reason for your general interest. Please be sure to provide your website and contact information. Thanks!

Pay is $500 cash per six days a week (Sundays off.)\n\n\n\nWhile the wages may seem meager, the real value of working as an apprentice is the hands-on experience you will gain.  If you have the intellectual capacity and curiosity to learn the trade, you will be saving around $18,000 that would otherwise be wasted on trade school (let's be honest, most kids don't learn a thing.)  This experience will provide you with all the knowledge you can gain at a trade school, AND MUCH MORE.\n\n\n\nThe starting pay is non-negotiable, but if you pick up on things quickly and add-value by acting to make the technician's job easier this will only be temporary.\n\nAnother major point is that we are not looking to churn-and-burn.  If you are a worthwhile apprentice, you will be able to hold the job past the summer (not get fired like with most companies) - and eventually become a technician in your own right.  The time it takes to become a technician depends solely on you!  Normally, it takes anywhere from a year to two years.  If you take the initiative to ask questions, remember and understand the answers and do research on your own (anything from watching YouTube videos after work to reading forums,) you will be able to advance fast.  If you did go to trade school and actually learned something, then you have a leg-up.\n\n\n\nPrevious apprentices are currently working with us on a 50% commission basis - all started as helpers to the owner of the company.\n\n\n\nIf you are stupid or lazy, don't bother - this is a thinking man's trade.\n\n\n\nWe take it for granted that all you know is the names of basic tools and how to use them (and not to lose them!) -This is all you need to prove to us; how did you learn to use tools?  The rest will be taught.  However, you must be physically capable of lifting heavy equipment such as tool boxes and refrigerant drums.  You must also not have an issue with climbing up latters and working on roofs.  You need to have a driver's license, and a car to get to work on time and occasionally meet with other technicians on separate jobs.  If you meet the above criteria, then we're in business.\n\n\n\nYou will gain exposure to myriad of different situations; you will work on commercial and residential jobs, trouble-shooting and installations, mid-temp and low-temp.  You will learn how to interact with customers.  You will learn the trade, and gain a skill-set that will put you in the position to find work whenever you want, whether it is a continued relationship with us, another company, or your own business.\n\n\n\nThis is a real ad posted by the company, and it will not cost you any money whatsoever to respond.  If you're interested, give us a call or text at (516) 244-5777.

I am also an award-winning playwright. My play ALL I WANT ran for two years in Chicago and I won Jeff Awards for BEST PLAY and BEST DIRECTOR. Last fall my new play, LAST CALL, played in NYC to strong reviews.\n\nHere is a list of my current finished spec scripts.\n\nFEATURE FILMS\n\nOVER THE BORDER...\n...a new drama that hits two hot-button issues, immigration and the #me too movement.\n\nLOGLINE -- An Arizona female state trooper on a dangerous mission to bust a human trafficking ring run by a Mexican Kingpin, places herself in double jeopardy when she files sexual harassment charges against the male officers working on the case and teams with a handsome Latino FBI agent to bring down the kingpin.\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/p/Bipzrdwg2gw/?taken-by=brucehickeyig\n\nBLOOD TATTOO\n\n...a dramatic feature/backdoor pilot, that three TV producers are looking at now.\n\nLOGLINE -- MIKEY, a female Iraq vet/Uber driver, seeks to be reunited with estranged daughter, JOSIE, who was taken away, when she killed her abusive husband. She gets a chance to earn the 25 grand she needs for legal fees, by proving that a real estate exec is innocent of murdering her boyfriend and beautiful assistant, who were having an affair. \n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/p/BhYwu3SA6Ct/?taken-by=brucehickeyig\n\nThe story hits hot button issues. Mikey, the female Iraq Vet/Uber driver, suffers PTSD from the war. Her daughter, Josie, attends a school where they've had a mass shooting. So, ironically, mother and daughter are victims of a culture of violence. The story, besides being a film noir mystery, is the healing journey of a mother and daughter.\n\nThe series would be about Mikey, a single mom with a teenager daughter, who helps folks underserved by the police and judicial system.\n\nTHE HOT MESS\n... a cutting edge musical drama that exposes the #metoo of the music biz...\n\nLOGLINE -- An aspiring female rock singer battles the self-destructive demons that are holding her back, caused by abuse and the absence of her father, a legendary guitar player who died before she was born. She steals his priceless guitar owned by his former manager in hopes she can connect with his spirit and set her life on the right path.\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/p/BPmmif0B-hP/?taken-by=brucehickeyig\n\nABOUT MY RECENT PRODUCED WORK\n\nBLINDSIDED BY LOVE, won its fifth film festival at the Hollywood Independent Filmmaker Awards, and they screened it in their ceremony at Paramount Pictures.\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/p/BY3sxMOlDHs/?taken-by=brucehickeyig\nLink to view the trailer-- https://www.vimeo.com/206341473#t=NaNs\n\n\nMy new play, LAST CALL, had a short developmental run at The Hudson Guild Theater in NYC got great reviews.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BXg7hqpl9Sv/?taken-by=brucehickeyig\n\nLinks to review\nhttp://t2conline.com/last-call-a-mind-game-that-surprises/\n\nIf interested to read me, please contact me.\n\nBest regards....\n    ","title":"AWARD-WINNING WRITER-DIRECTOR SEEKING MANAGER/PRODUCER","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/cwg/d/award-winning-writer-director/6598016007.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nHello,\n\nWe are going to be shooting two television shows within the next 2 months, one of them starting in June.

All we see is the end results of successful people, we never see the hard work they put into it. And it's not until they're in their 90's that they realize it's too late to do anything about it. I would love a poem that's meant to uplift, but with words that come across as tough love. Basically \"Yes you have dreams and no matter what they are, you can do it! But it requires hard work. And if you don't put in the hard work, you're going to die regretting it)\n\nMust be under two minutes. Everything I mentioned above is really just the 10,000 ft view of what I'm looking for. The poem will be used for a scene in a short film I'm doing. I'd love to see some of your work and if you're the right poet with the right voice, then I can fill you in on all the little details and we can get to work.\n\nThe job is paid! \n\nPlease respond with examples of your work, as well as your rate and how many rounds of revisions come with that rate.
