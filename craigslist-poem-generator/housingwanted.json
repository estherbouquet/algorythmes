[{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nHi! My name is JJ, I'm a 27 year old humanities PhD student in SF, and I'll be teaching an introduction to philosophy of race, gender, and sexuality at CCNY this fall through an exchange program. Mostly a quiet studious type who loves to cook at home, but hoping to spend as much time consuming as much music (and pastrami) as possible while I'm in the city. What I'm looking for is a room to sublet from Aug (dates flexible, somewhere between Aug 1 and Aug 20 is ideal) until Dec (around Dec 20, +/1 10 days). Depending on location and number of roommates, I'm very flexible on price, including studios for under 2k/mo. Greenpoint or Bushwick are ideal neighborhoods for me, I think.

Beware of the Con Woman\n\nDIANE ESTHER EDWARDS\n\nYou will probably be contacted by a con woman named Diane Edwards.

This can be verified on ripoffreport.com and ct.jud.gov case lookup. \n\nhttps://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/diane-e-edwards/norwalk-connecticut-06854/diane-e-edwards-diane-edwards-diane-e-edwards-con-artist-landlords-beware-of-this-so-876762\n\nShe is a horrible human being who preys on good people and has even thrown elderly and young children out into the streets just so she can get out of paying rent. She will order packages from 𝑨𝒎𝒂𝒛𝒐𝒏 and have them sent to your address so they show up the day she comes to see your place, then refuse to leave. When you call the police, she will claim she lives there, show them the \"mail\" from 𝑨𝒎𝒂𝒛𝒐𝒏 and then you will have to evict her. \n\nI am the 4th person I can verify that she has done this to. I have lost my home now as a result of what this woman has done but worse is what happened to my daughter, the worst possible thing that could happen to a young girl, because she couldn't go home. \n\nDiane is now looking for a new home because DCF has taken her daughter away from her and she will not be allowed to have her daughter until she finds another, more suitable home. \n\nIf you wish, I will provide additional information and photos that she provided of her own volition, plus security footage and audio recordings, as well as photos of my home she destroyed if your situation warrants the need. This information will not be given just because you want it. She needs to be stopped before she hurts anyone else or gets another innocent child molested.\n\nInitiating email from Diane Edwards\n\nGood Afternoon,\nSee below my information to apply for this rental.

Recently, I had an issue with my current apartment.  Being that I do not feel comfortable and safe in that apartment anymore, I have decided that I need to find an apartment soon. Everyone in my  previous apartment lived harmoniously. The chores were split and done by instinct, because we did not like to live in filth. We all respected each other's privacy , food , and personal things. Moving forward, in the paragraph below I will describe myself. \n\nAbout Me: \nAs a New York native, my communication and interpersonal skills are at their highest peak. I am a 23 year old male seeking a roommate who understands, not only the importance of hard work, but life in general. Currently, I am an Uber driver and I also work full time as a driver for a bread company within the Metropolitan area. Needless to say, I am always on the go. Non-smoker (it does not matter if my roommates smoke or not). I like animals, as long as you keep them clean and they don't invade or destroy my things, I have no issues with them being around. I am single with no dependents. I am non-religious. I am orderly and clean and just a laid-back person. I volunteer to do things without being told, that's just how I am. For example, if I see the dishes are piled up, I will wash them without looking around and asking who created them. I like to party sometimes, but I have mostly out grown that phase. Overall, I'm a hard-working laid-back guy that mind my business.\n\nWhat I'm Seeking:\nA private room/studio within the price range of $700-900 a month, which can be unfurnished, semi-furnished, or fully furnished, including ALL utilities/Wi-Fi/AC. If laundry is on-site, that would be great, but not necessary. The bathroom could be shared but a private one is more than welcome too. Bed-Stuy , Crown Heights And Flatbush locations would be ideal. All identities are welcome: any racial/ethnic identity, Lesbian/Gay/bisexual/transgender/etc. identities, national identity or other identity. It doesn't matter if the roommates are smokers or not. I would prefer one roommate only two at the most. What I seek in a roommate is what I offer as one: trust, decency, fairness and thoughtfulness\nI will provide a security deposit to hold the room and then first month's rent upon moving in (few days before the move).\nIf this fits the criteria for you, please reach out and tell me about yourself and your apartment/ the room. Feel free to include pictures if you have them. I am available anytime contact me via cell  show contact info\n) if I don't answer please text. \nThank You,\nDeMarrius\n    ","title":"NYC Driver Seeking Room or Studio Apartment","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/sha/d/nyc-driver-seeking-room-or/6579117333.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nshare furnished home with one person (Bethpage) $900 Plainview s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  show contact info\n  part barter considered lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll\n\n$900 Plainview share beautiful furnished house (plainview Nassau Ct.)\nshare nice furnished home plainview near all transportation on quiet street accross from small park ,one person wanted to share with owner everything is here including bedding silverware phones cable etc etc. available now00 per month includes utilities phone cable central air fenced in yard bar b que shed vegitable garden etc etc\n\nBright, clean and huge bedroom (approx. 190 sq. ft.)\n* All utilities included (central a/c & heat, cold and hot water, electricity)\n* Verizon FiOS Quantum Internet (50/25 Mbps) and FiOS TV Prime HD included\n* Laundry facility (washer & dryer)\n* Wall-to-wall carpeting, desk with chair, chest drawer, couch, closet and a full size bed towels beding, silverware, etc. etc.\n* Suburb living in a very nice and safe neighborhood\n* Private entrance\n* Parking on premises\n* Easy access to Long Island Expressway and Northern State Parkway\n* Minutes to SUNY Old Westbury, Long Island University C.W.

I am moving to NYC, and I am looking for \nA.) Potential roommates who would like to search for apartments to share together\nOr \nB.) Rooms that are already available\n\nI am looking to come around the end of June or the beginning of July :) \n\nAbout Me:\nI am going to school for nursing, and I'll be doing my first two years of school online so I can work, and then either move back home for the nursing program at UAB college, or stay in NYC, since I'll have in state tuition. I am coming from Alabama (Bet you didn't expect that huh? Haha), so it will be quite the cultural exchange. Which is okay with me, I feel like I need this city to mature me more and mold me into an adult that has truly seen it all. I think that's part of the problem today with people is that as young adults, in their main years of personal & social development, the years where they finally have the chance to do what they want to do and not what their parents want them to want to do, they don't get out , they haven't seen people who are different from them, so now as adults they don't care about people who aren't like them, because all they've ever interacted with is the town that's raised them. They don't have empathy, the can't relate. They don't feel like they can extend kindness to others unlike them. \nI'm just really trying to get out while I can. These years are mine, I'm not pregnant by some crappy boy from my hometown, I'm not following my high school sweetheart to college, I'm not taking care of my sick mother, I'm not battling cancer.\nI'm the only one I have to worry about. \nI believe showing myself \"The World\" (so dramatic, I know. I'm sure NYC is just a big trashcan but I've been obsessed with going there since I was 14. LET ME BE EXCITED LOL)\nIs the biggest, most kind, gesture of love I can offer my forever self. I know it's hard to move to NYC, but not near as hard to \"make it\". I get that people are mean and stuff is expensive, and I'm young so I should try to live with my parents as long as I can, I get that. I'm not near as naive as I probably sound, being this exited to move. However, the city has a population of 8.1 million people. Are you really going to tell me it's ridiculous to think there's not people in my exact situation, doing it? Getting jobs? Making money? Making friends? Seeing shit?\nI'm young, I'm healthy, physically and mentally. I have all my limbs, I can work long hours with little sleep and still function. I'm willing to learn anything. I actually WANT to be in the city, so I'll work for it. I'm in America? I realize there's other countries that have just as many freedoms as the U.S if not more. I know. But this country is mine and has so many opportunities for me. I'm so able. One day I'll be old and probably have some some kind of thing that makes me not as good then that I am now. I'm not gonna be like this forever, NOW is the time to do the hard stuff. \nSpeaking of, I'm only 18!!! \nI know everyone who even thought of offering me their room probably just sighed and if they haven't already, pressed the back button to send them back to the list so they can find someone else. I get it lol. I don't have credit!!! I turned 18 less than 6 months ago, I don't have a credit score. But I know someone needs rent money just as bad as I need a place to rent, so they'll accept my first and last months rent, my bag of foreign shit I brought them from Alabama, and move on haha. \nMy budget is $800 a month. For the BEST room, location, and roommates I'd go up to $900, don't be scared to send me rooms for $900 :) \nI can give you 2 months rent. First and last, first and second? Last month and a security deposit? First month and a security deposit? I don't care what ya call it. 2 months rent is what I have \nI'm so not picky. As long as there's no bugs and you're not a sex offender I don't care (I'm saying this and I already know someone is going to send me some crazy, off the wall room like, \"it doesn't have bugs and we're not sex offenders here :)\" . Pls don't haha) \nI don't mind a sketchy location, seeing how I've lived in a \"sketchy\" location too, and it wasn't even actually sketchy. There just wasn't any white people and men sat outside wearing wife beater tank tops. They were still good people. Kids were still being raised with loving parents. \nI don't smoke cigarettes or do drugs. I don't mind it but I do NOT wanna live in a trap house. I've drank occasionally? It's not my thing. I'll drink every now and then but I can't see myself at 21, using my own money on alcohol. Not my thing, but it's okay if it's yours! I don't party but it's okay if you do.\nI'm pretty shy at first but once I warm up I'm the best (Just kidding haha).\nI'm quiet, I clean up after myself, and I'm very considerate of others. \nI have applications put in at multiple hospitals in the city for nurse tech positions. Here in Alabama I work 3-4 12 hour night shifts a week, so I'll be at work during the night, and asleep during the day, the times I do work. I've only applied for night shift positions, plus 2-3 day shift positions. So chances are I'll be working night shift. \nDo you know what this means? This means you get like HALF a roommate, who's paying full rent!!! \nIf you have dogs that's great. I'm never going to get upset at you or your precious sweet amazing perfect puppy because I step in dog poop. I love dogs.

If you are looking for full time work with a free room and salary, there are Nanny sites that do government background checks, fingerprint checks, credit checks etc, before you work with children. Sometimes these jobs include free room and board. In NYC you have to be professional in your credentials, not just post an ad that you want a babysitting job with a free room, cause you have no money. Parents can afford to be very picky here.\n\nYou have to be qualified to work with children! Licensed early childhood teachers or nurses can apply. These jobs are competitive as all jobs are in NYC. No one is going to feel sorry for you here and give you a free room in exchange for working with their children! That's dangerous and murders of children by inexperienced Nannys are in the newspapers and TV.

The way to do this is to find a job where you live and save up money to move.\n\nMany young people here think someone in NYC can host them for free, for a few months, while they look for a job? No. No one can afford that. This is a roommate or rental site. People who have a room need to charge MARKET RATE, because their landlord is charging THEM market rate.\n\nSo if you have a dream to move to NYC that's great. Save your money and move here. Sure some people can move here in college, they have rich parents and can prove it with bank statements. It's expensive to live here. Don't expect to move here with no money.\n\nPLEASE, PLEASE do not come here to go to private college and take out enormous student loans for tuition and rent in Manhattan! If you DO decide to go to school here, NO ONE has to live a 5 minute walk to school. You DON'T have to live in the Village, Upper East Side or Upper West Side. Make do with a Metrocard and commute from Queens or whatever borough.

This must be very common in other parts of the country. It is NOT welcome in NYC. The real estate prices here are VERY HIGH. They are also in HIGH DEMAND. Any one with a separate room has their choice of many people wanting the room for MARKET RATE. A housekeeping job is part time, a few hours a week and pays minimum wage. It does not equal the rent for a room in an apt here.\n\nOut of Towners looking for a free bartered room usually demand Manhattan! It's a $2000/month room and your housekeeping skills aren't worth that much! Then you want furnishings, free internet and utilities! And some ask for a private apt!\n\nAnyone looking for a roommate is not saying \"Hey! Why don't I just get a free housekeeper instead!!!\" Anyone looking for a professional maid goes to an agency, not Craigslist. It's a low wage job, unless you are working for the Trumps or Clintons.\n\nAnd then you have ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR FREE ROOM! What a joke! Like \"No Cooking, just errand running!

Yikes, for 20 somethings you certainly aren't internet savvy!\n\nIf you can't afford the rents here, Do NOT come here. Anyone who is looking for a roommate cannot afford to do you a favor. No one is willing to pay 75% of the rent, so you can pay 25%. Grow up!\n\nTry to be realistic about the apt. No millionaire is renting out rooms. There is no private extra bathroom. Yes you might have to walk up. A private entrance is called a studio apt. And no one has \"extra\" rooms. You're lucky to get ANYTHING! Demand exceeds supply!\n\nAnd yes you will have to take the subway. Count on a one hour commute average. Each way. No one walks to school or work.\n\n$800/month for a room in the Bronx, more in Queens and Brooklyn, MUCH more in Manhattan.\n\nYes we are all struggling and juggling here.

Not couples. Reason is simple. Why share the bathroom and kitchen with 2 people, when you can share with one? Most 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apts have ONE bathroom! No these apts weren't meant for 3 couples of 6 adults and it's illegal against fire code besides. \n\nCouples feel they're entitled to have a second person to live for free. No for your information, if you are part of a couple, you MIGHT get a room by paying EXTRA for the extra roommate! Novel idea huh?\n\nMost likely, you won't have any luck getting a couple, \"buy one, get one free\" room. Your best bet is looking for a studio. Or looking in a much less desirable hard to fill area.\n\nOk a studio can run you $1350-$1500/mo in Queens. Much less in Staten Island, about $1000 (but you might need a car). Less in the Bronx, maybe a studio for about $1100? Cost more in Brooklyn. Manhattan studios start at $2000, so I guess you can't walk to work! You must pay first, last months security and one months brokers fee. Nothing in your budget is \"walkable\" or \"30 minute commute\".  or 2 blocks to the subway! Try an hour. Don't know about the interns that want a place for a few months. Probably they can just stay home.\n\nOr move to NJ. Look in Newport, it's near a Mall.\n\nLast week I saw an ad for 3 adults and 2 dogs who want to squeeze into ONE ROOM to save for an apt! Uh NO!

Landlords are not looking on Craiglist for \"cheap\" renters to fill their apts! There are 10 people in a day who want to rent an apt!\n\nIf you want an apt in NYC you really must go to a broker. Sometimes they will have no-fee apts. Unless you know someone who has a vacancy in their building, then this is the way it is done. You might get lucky and find one in a million on the internet, but more likely you will be sleeping on the subway. You will mostly have no luck posting on here and begging for a no broker \"cheap\" apt. It's a crapshoot. Is that what you want?\n\nNo I don't work for a real estate company. but plenty of times I have rented out my apt and I put up an ad on CL getting TONS of replies in one day. Landlords can pick and choose. There are no \"cheap\" or \"reasonable\" apts.\n\nMuch more sensible to get your own apt and then advertise for your own roommate. Yeah, obviously it's cheaper to have your roommate pay all the fees and furnish the place too. Then you want 2 people to split the room!!! Why would anyone take 2 people to share the bathroom and kitchen when they can have one? Some posters even want 4 people to squeeze into a room while they save for an apt!!! Or 3 adults and 2 huge dogs for $200/mo!!! This is illegal and against FDNY laws. This is cause for eviction.\n\nYou really have to research what apts are going for and divide that by the amount of bedrooms. Finances are all math. If you are listing a BELOW MARKET price for \"room wanted\" don't be shocked if you get no real responses. Fingers crossed won't do it. I have time to write educational posts, but MOST PEOPLE ARE WAY TOO BUSY TO STRAIGHTEN YOU OUT. And by the way, in Manhattan space is very expensive. No one has extra empty rooms that they can rent out for a lowball price. Millionaires are not looking for roommates.\n\nYesterday someone wants to rent a room for 7 cats! Huh?

I will be staying in temporary housing from May 16 - May 26, so my time is running short! I received a relocation bonus from Google to cover my housing for the summer, but I was scammed and I lost the majority of it. So this is why I am making this post, to save myself from my impending homelessness. \n\nI will be available during these 10 days to visit and tour apartments and meet in person.\n\nIf you happen to know of any apartments that offer subleasing or cheap rent (something below 1500 probably) and doesnt require an initial deposit(I'm pretty poor at the moment, I really can't put down a lot) , please let me know. I dont care about the quality of the apartment, or the location (not that I really have a choice). I just ask that it have basic furnishing, such as a bed and kitchen appliances. \n\nPlease anyone, help me out. I'm in a grave situation and I need to find something quickly. Google pays their interns well, so you can count on me to pay my rent on time! I am responsible and dutiful. Although I don't have much to offer upfront, I will definitely have enough money to make my rent payments at the end of every month. \n\nThank you for your time!!!!\n\ndo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers    ","title":"Sublet apartment/room needed ASAP for Google Intern","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/sbw/d/sublet-apartment-room-needed/6591045939.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nHi!

Can you help me please? I'm a GAY Mixed Black Man - Very LGBTQ Friendly & I immediately in need to rent a clean room RIGHT NOW for $125.00 cash (no deposit), in which I'll stay in for the dates from Sunday, May 20, 2018 thru Saturday, May 27, 2018. Has anyone in Manhattan lost EVERYTHING & maybe you can relate. I lost my home, my job, my savings, & starting over with complete new beginning, and every step that I take for the better seems to only result in the worse. THIS IS ME RIGHT NOW- just got a new job. Just me Being mixed black ethnicity has me still discriminated upon. Being poor has me judged as homeless because of my over-washed clothing but that's all I have that can fit on my body. Being big, tall, & with a thick body that's somewhat feminine because of flabby, has some people thinking I'm transgender-but it's my body. Being and looking just a little older than 40 has most people that age, has people thinking that I'm over experienced with life. But all I have is Just enough money in my pocket to get by, to cover a clean room for $125.00 for one week. I'm suffering to make ends meet, being able to eat, drink, walk, & talk has me very thankful to GOD although I have No Family, since I'm Gay & like the taste-touch-& feel of good size dick. I have No Friends, since they can turn on you in a blink of an eye especially with no money and they're being masculine heterosexual. No one in NYC seems to want to help and everyone sees that since I have eczema/psoriasis that I was born with & inherited from think that I'm never to have sex or be spoken to or to be touched. I've been picked on in school as a child and now as an adult, but it's okay, I've now been able to accept being and feeling isolated--there's a reason for it. My deformity - I have blood vessel sensitivity, internal/external inflammation, hormone deficiency, & very low immunity which imbalances my entire body. With osteoarthritis and arthritis I deal with daily 'on & off' cramps. I'm seriously that 'boy in the bubble' that everyone treats as an complete outcast. Every moment of the day I'm depressed, wanting another being with a samaritan heart who wouldn't mind being my other half, that can walk with me on my journey. Who knows, I might just choose to become transsexual-I've always been somewhat feminine with my character and some of my actions but not that flamboyant. I don't mind if other men are like that. I have a thick beard facial hair, salt & pepper head hair, & speak with proper verbal etiquette. I accept anyone, just as they are. Why would I judge. Only GOD judges us all. I intake prescribed holistic vitamins & pain medication daily. I just need a residence that's clean and a good habitat that's quiet, that I can hot shower (in the morning & at night) & relieve body waste. A Place that I can just reheat a little food or 'whip up' a quick meal. A place that I can have a private bed that can hold 363 lbs and 6'3 in height. A place that I can have ventilation-an open window-I need air to help with my breathing. I don't smoke anything at all & I don't drink alcoholic beverages. I just go to work, physical therapy due to congested blood flow throughout my body, particularly my arms & legs. I. daily listen to my MP3 or watch movies on my mobile phone and stay to myself. I'll go to the movies or dine at a eatery once in a blue moon'. I'm a complete loner and to many people a complete loser. To some, I'm a fag - a sissy and to others - a nobody. I just want someone who genuinely can reply with a genuine heart. If a relationship came with it- okay. But acceptance & equality of me being in the LGBTQ community has also blocked me. If you're transgender - I don't mind. I'm just me & you're just you. Can you please help me if you care? I don't have pictures of myself & I don't have sex with just anyone unless it's a connection between you and I and we use condoms. I can get a guy off and give massages. I'm tidy & organized and I have only one carry-case and shoulder bag that holds all my belongings. Can someone just see my heart and not pre-determine without asking me what you want to know. I'm sane & very respectful. I'll answer you. My new co-worker says I'm unique, genuine, abnormal in my own way & just not as everyone else in this world. If you're unique, genuine, & abnormal in you're own way, then reply respectfully. If we're all the same then this entire world would very boring. If we were all normal & the same, then, we wouldn't have affection or interest in getting to know one another. Right or Wrong? If you have the same mentality or experiencing life with obstacles as me then I implore you & await your reply. I only ask from whoever you are.....understanding Please do not ask for me to send pictures of how I look. I have a very small dick so you wouldn't need to see it & besides I'm a bottom. I'm not on any social media nor do I want to sign up to any website or forum. I'm too 'old school'. I don't have pics of me. If you're renting immediately then we can meet, face to face if you're SERIOUS. Legitimately there are some really good- hearted, good-natured people who do not need to see pictures of someone else. Rent to me from your heart. This is an ad for legitimate help from a Samaritan that has a clean room that I can stay in for $125.00 for one week please. Thank You in Advance and accept my heartfelt honest and seeking for your serious generous help. \n:-)    ","title":"MAY I PLEASE HAVE A HELPING HAND FROM YOU?","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sha/d/may-please-have-helping-hand/6584343338.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nDo you have aging parents, possibly with medical issues, who need assistance with shopping, driving, overseeing/managing the house?

My travel schedule is flexible. But I'm probably most interested in swapping sometime in Spring. My apartment is available throughout the year. The swap does not have to be simultaneous. Please reply to this ad if you're interested.\n\nI have a 1BR condo (700 sq ft) in a quiet, well maintained, mid-century building located in the Spa Zone of Desert Hot Springs, CA. 1 Bedroom (queen size mattress), full Bath, Living Room, Dining Area and Kitchen. On-site laundry and off-street parking available.\n\nThis beautiful mid-century modern, spacious condo is a fully furnished apartment and provides a comfortable and stylish 'home away from home' nestled in the hills of Desert Hot Springs. Apartment comes with a full kitchen, walk-in closet, central heat and air conditioning. Original mid-century details and furnishings throughout. The open floor plan lend itself to casual and relaxed living.\n\nThe front doors lead out to a large patio with palm trees and a pool. Your backdrop during the warm sunny days and star filled desert nights will be the spectacular views of the Little San Bernardino Mountains. Enjoy the panoramic mountain and valley views and the nearby windmill fields. It's a perfect setting to simply relax and rejuvenate.\n\nThe apartment is freeway close, near bus lines, shopping, grocery stores, and restaurants. It's a 15 minute drive to Palm Springs, 30 minutes to Joshua Tree, 2 hours to San Diego or Los Angeles, and just 20 minutes to the best discount shopping at Cabazon Outlet Mall. Two of the areas premiere golf courses are less than a 5 min drive. Nearby is a city park with tennis and basketball courts, a baseball field, and skating course.

Couples are so cute, they want other people subsidize their existence. Even in rare occasions when couples are descent, they are nuisance,  always on or the other will be around, more utility, bathroom use, kitchen use, fridge space, more noise, two people together are  noisier for sure, ONE WAY OF ANOTHER JUST BY DOING THEIR EVERYDAY MUNDANE things, they fight, they can become two against one or against all, nothing good usually comes out from having couples, it is not for nothing that most people won't accept couples, and if two people can't afford a studio, be suspicious defend your best interest not theirs. Still if you want to do it add at least 50% more to the rent, if you have more other roommates more often than not  adding couples will stir the balance and peace\n\nAre you thinking about renting a spare room or have a lease on your name? Think twice:\n\n- Good number (of course there are exceptions - pay attention to the word exception) are people that can barely survive in NYC, no credits, low income or unreliable source of income.\n\n-They can't pass the credit verification from property management companies, so they go to the informal craigslist world where the verification is lapsed. \n\n-They will be late paying rent but will not give up smoking or and their green herbal supplement \n\n-Cooking their own meal rarely an option, why save money on take out if you can live beyond your means and can be constantly late with the rent, screw the landlord or roommate.\n\n- why Give up or less beer and frequent visits to bars?  no way Jose. \n\n- Usually the ones that can least afford are the one to have guest over more often than should and be the loudest asses and have all this speech of right and wrong and what is acceptable, surprisingly nothing in favor of the others. \n\n-The first day of the month  the person always have excuses to be late with rent, first few times will be a couple days, than it will just increase to 5 days, 7, 10...... patterns, patterns, don't ignore.\n\n-Everyone lies, verify everything, do not trust  references, contact former landlord, make sure they are the actual landlord not some jerk posing as landlord or roommate, check utility bills paid on time, check credit, check employment and employment, check bank accounts. Some people are very convincing, and obviously we are not equipped with instantaneous  polygraph,  most people have invested more in being deceptive than doing the right thing, the great majority have a sense of entitlement that is hard to be believed, and they truly believe they are entitled to whatever their twisted mind decides, filtering these a variety of nut cases is nearly impossible, at least put in place clauses that may help you deal with them appropriately. \n\n-Never accept labor as payment or partial payment, it does not work each party will very soon have opposite definitions, dissaster for sure. \n\n-If you do not want smoker, Check person teeth, if yellowish, 99% chance they are smoker, 90% of smokers lie about it, and it is just a matter of time before they start smoking in the house. \n\n-Don't be shy, ask for credit card, debit card statement, see how much they owe, how much they spend in bars, restaurant and unnecessary entertainment and match against their salary, people that don't share are the ones you don't want. \nAlthough a few  people that are in bad situations sometimes are for some unfortunate events, the great majority are not, so since you can't be sure, avoid at all cost. \n\n-check craigslist posting, you will notice that are people posting the same thing over and over for months and years, some describe situations that could not be true several months later, one that sticks out is a woman posting that she has to move because the landlady sold the property, it must be the longest sale closing  in history, two years later the tale  is the same, she also mentions that she is such a catch that landlord lower her rent instead of raising, by the way she wants a place for $500 or less with all included.\n\n-If you do not want weed in your house, don't ask, just invite the person if they want to share a joint, it works every time. Of course in NYC 90% of people are week smoker, but not all pot heads are alike, some will burn your place down. \n\n-People with pets: even if you love pets, check the pets first, better if you pay a surprise visit where the person live ask for the vet bills on the spot, people can fake it, better be by surprise,see if shots and check up visits are up to date, if they can't afford a pet it is unlikely they can afford rent or sacrifice one for the other, everyone is animal lover and responsible with their pets, until they move in and you will learn firsthand their definition  of responsible, some people even move and leave pets behind, others stay away for more than 12 hours, some dogs are not housebroken, not exercised properly and stress will make them bark etc, charge more for pets, people that really love them will pay, if you are animal lover you can always refund if the person turns out to be responsible, \n\n-Everyone is clean and professional, place in writing all the minuscule detail what clean means, from trash to dirty dishes, AS SAD AS IT IS you may have to spell out in the contract what clean means, real time cleaning, and some people don't know how to clean, get it of these people if you care about descent clean environment (not OCD), they will always be trouble even if they clean.\n\n-Draw a very detailed contract and provisions dictating different fee structure if person is late, brings visitor more than x numbers days per month, if they are late more than x number times with rent., the best way of doing it is if you want $800 a month, do the contract for $1,100 and the tenant/roommate will get a discount if  rent will be $800 if all provisions respected, so basically you are not raising the rent, but charging the actual value, but be honest about, do not overreact for any little minor issue, warning usually is the best approach.\n\n-out of state people are the worse, no history, hard to verify, be extra careful, better check how many addresses they had for the last 3 years.\n\n-people that  go around bad mouthing the world and making themselves victims of everything and everyone, no brainier, stay away\nMost important 2 months security deposit, people that don't have a least 3 months of rent are irresponsible or live beyond their means, again there are exceptions out there, but do you want to risk since the exception  might be less than 10%?\n\n-never forgive late payment unless, except if one year has passed and the person was never late, one time forgiveness only. \n-there are online services that will do background including eviction history  search for landlords and  roommates, you can charge $30, if the person has nothing to worry won't mind paying $30 or you do yourself, $30 is better than the potential hassle\n\nThe truth is, people always have excuse to do you wrong, you will never come across people giving you excuse for paying before the due date or for more than their fair share. \n\nDon't forget to be a good roommate or landlord, it is a two way street, spell out what you want and make people sign, yet do not twist things around just because you can, it can back fire on your face. \n\n\n\n\n    ","title":"IF YOU HAVE  A ROOM  OR MAY BE  LOOKING FOR ROMMATES","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sha/d/if-you-have-room-or-may-be/6587957833.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nAny size- needing short term stay while home is being repaired!!!!\n\nUES will also be considered    ","title":"Urgent!

I am a 32 year old professional and own a house and work in the DC metro area. I love NYC, am there frequently, and am looking for a part time place to stay for the weekends (either late Thursday night or Friday afternoon through the weekend leaving Monday afternoon) in Manhattan only, preferably close to midtown. \n\nI am ideally looking for a furnished space (if not I would be happy to bring an air mattress), and since it is only part time, I am looking for ~$500/mo.  I would likely need the ability to telework from this location on either Fridays and/or Mondays. \n\nI currently have this exact arrangement through the end of June in a lovely location in Chelsea and would be happy to meet with you on one of the weekends that I am in town to see if we would be compatible roommates.  If that works out, I would be happy to ask my current roommate to provide reference to how my current arrangement has gone for us, upon your request. \n\nI am super friendly, and will likely be out and about most of the time. I will likely rarely use the kitchen - I love going out to eat, which is partly why I love being in New York on the weekends.  If you like food as much as I do, we will probably get along (I am always looking for new food friends)! I rarely, if ever, drink. I am open to socializing and love making new friends.   I don't smoke or have pets. I am very respectful and dependable, I have a good job, and I am extremely responsible. \n\nThis would be a great arrangement if you have a unique situation (need a part time tenant/are in another city for the weekends/looking for a little extra cash etc.)!\n\nSince I already have this arrangement through the end of June, I would be looking to start around the first weekend of July and am flexible on start timing. Also, since I have a home in DC, if there are weekends you need the space (have family/guests in town etc.) I can be flexible.  \n\nHappy to provide any additional info you may be wondering about via email or in person. I look forward to hearing from you!

I'm a professional worker with a full-time job in the tech industry, and I'm looking for a room to move into at the end of May.\n\nFirst, a little about myself. In terms of personality, I'm an introvert, and I can also be shy at times. I usually do stay home to recharge after going out.\n\nI am respectful, clean/hygienic, responsible, friendly, and I do not smoke (though I'm 420-friendly). I look for the same qualities in prospective roommates. Also, I'm totally down to play board or videogames, if you're into those :)\n\nI'm more of a night owl, and I currently work from 4PM to midnight Monday through Friday (including some days from home).\n\nEnough about me! Here are the requirements I'm looking for in an apartment (in no particular order, and I can be flexible on some for the right place):\n* in NYC\n* $700-$1100/month (ideally including utilities, and I'll pay no more than 1st month and 1 month security up-front)\n* no broker fee\n* safe neighborhood (i.e., you'd be fine with your own daughter walking home from the train after midnight)\n* ground floor (or has an elevator)\n* unfurnished bedroom comfortably fits king bed (10' x 12' minimum)\n* quiet environment (e.g., minimal noise from neighbors, planes, trains, automobiles, animals, banging radiators, etc.)\n* reliable high-speed Internet\n* 3- to 5-month lease permitted (ideally with month-to-month option afterward)\n* great mobile carrier quality in the bedroom (T-Mobile, US Cellular, or Sprint)\n* LGBT-friendly residence\n* laundry machines within unit/building/1 short block (250 ft.)\n* if you cook meat or seafood, you're ok using fans, open windows, candles, etc.\n* electronic payment accepted for rent and utilities (Zelle, Paypal, Google Wallet, etc.)\n* within 2 long blocks (1400 ft.) of a subway stop\n* ~30 minutes to Tribeca\n* no more than 3 people to a bathroom\n* overnight guests permitted (mostly on weekends, not anything crazy)\n\nFor some of these, there may be some wiggle room. And before you balk at my requirements, know that I've lived in 4 apartments so far that met all (or most) of these, so I know they're out there!\n\nI'm looking to move at the end of May. I'm a bit flexible with the exact date, but ideally within the second half of the month.\n\nPlease contact me only if you have a room that satisfies all of these requirements to some degree. Please be up-front about which requirements are not fully met so no one's time is wasted. And please provide at least 2 pictures of the room itself, as well as at least one picture of each common room (kitchen, living room, etc.).\n\nAdditionally, please let me know what led to the room's vacancy (if there was an occupant here previously, is there any particular reason why they left that I should know about)?\n\nThanks for reading, and do feel free to ask me questions, of course :)    ","title":"Professional looking for mid-term sublet","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/sbw/d/professional-looking-for-mid/6590266440.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \n.

The way to do this is to find a job where you live and save up money to move.\n\nMany young people here think someone in NYC can host them for free, for a few months, while they look for a job? No. No one can afford that. This is a roommate or rental site. People who have a room need to charge MARKET RATE, because their landlord is charging THEM market rate.\n\nSo if you have a dream to move to NYC that's great. Save your money and move here. Sure some people can move here in college, they have rich parents and can prove it with bank statements. It's expensive to live here. Don't expect to move here with no money.\n\nPLEASE, PLEASE do not come here to go to private college and take out enormous student loans for tuition and rent in Manhattan! If you DO decide to go to school here, NO ONE has to live a 5 minute walk to school. You DON'T have to live in the Village, Upper East Side or Upper West Side.

Not couples. Reason is simple. Why share the bathroom and kitchen with 2 people, when you can share with one? Most 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apts have ONE bathroom! No these apts weren't meant for 3 couples of 6 adults and it's illegal against fire code besides. \n\nCouples feel they're entitled to have a second person to live for free. No for your information, if you are part of a couple, you MIGHT get a room by paying EXTRA for the extra roommate! Novel idea huh?\n\nMost likely, you won't have any luck getting a couple, \"buy one, get one free\" room. Your best bet is looking for a studio. Or looking in a much less desirable hard to fill area.\n\nOk a studio can run you $1350-$1500/mo in Queens. Much less in Staten Island, about $1000 (but you might need a car). Less in the Bronx, maybe a studio for about $1100? Cost more in Brooklyn. Manhattan studios start at $2000, so I guess you can't walk to work! You must pay first, last months security and one months brokers fee. Nothing in your budget is \"walkable\" or \"30 minute commute\".  or 2 blocks to the subway! Try an hour. Don't know about the interns that want a place for a few months. Probably they can just stay home.\n\nOr move to NJ. Look in Newport, it's near a Mall.\n\nLast week I saw an ad for 3 adults and 2 dogs who want to squeeze into ONE ROOM to save for an apt! Uh NO! That's against the fire codes and cause for eviction!

Yikes, for 20 somethings you certainly aren't internet savvy!\n\nIf you can't afford the rents here, Do NOT come here. Anyone who is looking for a roommate cannot afford to do you a favor. No one is willing to pay 75% of the rent, so you can pay 25%. Grow up!\n\nTry to be realistic about the apt. No millionaire is renting out rooms. There is no private extra bathroom. Yes you might have to walk up. A private entrance is called a studio apt. And no one has \"extra\" rooms. You're lucky to get ANYTHING! Demand exceeds supply!\n\nAnd yes you will have to take the subway. Count on a one hour commute average. Each way. No one walks to school or work.\n\n$800/month for a room in the Bronx, more in Queens and Brooklyn, MUCH more in Manhattan.\n\nYes we are all struggling and juggling here.

The whole place is in a constant state of disrepair. The roads are a mess, the whole state smells of farts yet we somehow block it out with selective odor perception. A decent chunk of properties out there haven't been updated since Josh Hartnett was steadily receiving roles yet $2,100 a month still isn't enough for a ONE bedroom apartment in Nassau county. How is this possible?\n\nI'm 50% of a stable, functioning unit. AKA married, both in professional careers that we went to school to become qualified to do. Credit scores over 700, no criminal record, no evictions, never late on rent yet for some god forsaken reason we are destined to remain in this apartment complex that uses the word 'Luxury' in its title for nothing other than a cruel inside joke as in once you're inside, you get the joke...And it's not funny. Today I went to get the mail and saw a guy that looked like a fat Willy Nelson outside in his underwear. He seemed busy so I didn't say hello.\n\nWe don't ask for much. Nassau County. A BY OWNER listing (no brokers).  No basements-- Anyone who can with complete and utter confidence ask a person to pay more than $2,000 to live underground like a gopher in a basement has to take a moment and reconsider their lives. A washer/dryer would be ace! I like clean clothes and being able to get them from the dryer to the closet without having to worry about falling on the ice whilst holding the bag. A bedroom, also amazing! A kitchen you can fit more than one person in. A bath tub. It would be convenient to have a front door that leads to outside and not a dark, narrow stairwell leading to the front door. No bells or whistles, really. Just a place you can come home to after a long day, sigh and think 'I'm home' and kick your feet up with a cup of tea and watch some netflix or read a book. \n\n    ","title":"How is it that $2,100 is NOT enough for a measley 1 bedroom?!","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/hou/d/how-is-it-that-2100-is-not/6590149254.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nThis is a Sublet / Individual /Temporary rental \nPrivate room in 2BR Apartment Shared Common Space \nAll utilities + WiFi included / Fully Furnished \n\nEasy in and out commute to Manhattan \nThis listing appeals to extended stay travelers, someone moving to NYC and in need of a place to land or someone awaiting a departure date.

Any one with a separate room has their choice of many people wanting the room for MARKET RATE. A housekeeping job is part time, a few hours a week and pays minimum wage. It does not equal the rent for a room in an apt here.\n\nOut of Towners looking for a free bartered room usually demand Manhattan! It's a $2000/month room and your housekeeping skills aren't worth that much! Then you want furnishings, free internet and utilities!

Landlords are not looking on Craiglist for \"cheap\" renters to fill their apts! There are 10 people in a day who want to rent an apt!\n\nIf you want an apt in NYC you really must go to a broker. Sometimes they will have no-fee apts. Unless you know someone who has a vacancy in their building, then this is the way it is done. You might get lucky and find one in a million on the internet, but more likely you will be sleeping on the subway. You will mostly have no luck posting on here and begging for a no broker \"cheap\" apt. It's a crapshoot. Is that what you want?\n\nNo I don't work for a real estate company. but plenty of times I have rented out my apt and I put up an ad on CL getting TONS of replies in one day. Landlords can pick and choose. There are no \"cheap\" or \"reasonable\" apts.\n\nMuch more sensible to get your own apt and then advertise for your own roommate. Yeah, obviously it's cheaper to have your roommate pay all the fees and furnish the place too. Then you want 2 people to split the room!!! Why would anyone take 2 people to share the bathroom and kitchen when they can have one? Some posters even want 4 people to squeeze into a room while they save for an apt!!! Or 3 adults and 2 huge dogs for $200/mo!!! This is illegal and against FDNY laws. This is cause for eviction.\n\nYou really have to research what apts are going for and divide that by the amount of bedrooms. Finances are all math. If you are listing a BELOW MARKET price for \"room wanted\" don't be shocked if you get no real responses. Fingers crossed won't do it. I have time to write educational posts, but MOST PEOPLE ARE WAY TOO BUSY TO STRAIGHTEN YOU OUT. And by the way, in Manhattan space is very expensive. No one has extra empty rooms that they can rent out for a lowball price. Millionaires are not looking for roommates.\n\nYesterday someone wants to rent a room for 7 cats! Huh?

It is a recently built 3 stories high house (plus basement) with a terrace and a small swimming pool in a relaxed area of the City.\n\nThe house fits 8 people comfortably. The main bedroom is on the first floor and is perfect for a couple, with an extra large bed, full bathroom and dressing room and direct access to a spacious and bright office for two.\n\nThe other 3 rooms are on the second floor. They are all the same size and with a full set of wardrobes each, with access to two full bathrooms (one with a shower, the other one with a bathtub). One has a large bed for two, another one has an individual bed (and could fit an additional mattress or extra bed if need be) and the last one has two individual beds plus a small sofa-bed for a kid or a toddler, which could be placed elsewhere.\n\nThe house sports a fantastic and spacious living room/dining room with a high ceiling and surrounded in its entirety by large windows that lead to the terrace, all with automatic shutters and blinds so that you can control the amount of light you want from the outside. The living room also has a huge 3 meter wide projector screen and home cinema system!\n\nThe terrace has wooden floors and is surrounded by beautiful and carefully selected plants, has a small patch of grass and a small (5.5m x 2m) swimming pool perfect to cool down in hot Madrid summer days. The pool can also be covered and thus the terrace gets expanded.\n\nThe kitchen is connected to the terrace, which is perfect when you want to eat or dine outside and very convenient whenever you want to prepare a BBQ. It has a large fridge, dishwasher, oven, microwave, toaster, etc.\n\nThe basement floor has a playing room with a big and comfy sofa, which is perfect for kids.\n\nIt is close to Arturo Soria, which has all the niceties of a very residential area without having to leave the City. It is an a particularly quiet area, so absolutely no noise at night. It is at a walking distance from three really nice restaurants, a mall with additional places to eat as well as shops, supermarkets, etc.\n\nIt is exceptionally well connected. Literally a few minutes walk away from an underground station and equally close to 3 bus lines towards the center. It is also minutes away from the M-30 (the smallest ring highway that surrounds Madrid through which you can pretty much drive anywhere in town) and has good access to the M-40 (the second ring around Madrid)\n\nGetting to and from the airport couldn't be easier by Taxi (20€ ride) or Underground (20 minutes).

Set among the clouds on the 77th floor, this luxury New York City vacation rental affords views of Central Park, the George Washington Bridge and even the planes taking off from LaGuardia. The views inside are just as stunning, thanks to luxe finishes and custom-designed pieces, and the 2 bedrooms and world-class amenities make for a pampering adults-only holiday.\n\nYour stay at Midtown Penthouse includes access to the building's 10,000-square-foot spa and health club, 60-foot pool and private garden. If you've driven to New York, leave your car with the valet, and if you need assistance with reservations or tickets, the 24/7 concierge will be happy to help. Thanks to a recent renovation, the lights, music, video, climate and even the shades in the penthouse can all be controlled through a smart-home system with the touch of a button on your smartphone or tablet.\n\nSoaring ceilings and huge windows flood the villa's interiors with light, and thoughtful decor by DGD Group Design lends a fresh, modern appeal. The great room's white-oak herringbone floors are an elegant yet understated backdrop for a sleek white sectional, low-slung leather settee and Missoni pouf in the sitting area, mod grey chairs and a geometric area rug in the dining area, and crisp white Caesarstone counters and high-end appliances in the state-of-the-art Pedini kitchen.\n\nEach of the two bedrooms at Midtown Penthouse faces east, letting in morning light and gorgeous river views, and features walnut closets custom-made in Italy by Pianca. There are two bedrooms with king beds and en-suite , and one bedroom with a queen bed bathroom.\n\nThe villa's location in Midtown East puts you at the heart of the city, close to both family favorites such as Central Park, the Empire State Building and Broadway, and the after-dark attractions of Times Square and the Lincoln Center. Shop the tempting windows of nearby Fifth Avenue, catch the latest exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art or spend an afternoon with an icon at the Statue of Liberty. When it's time to leave, plan on an 8-mile trip to LaGuardia Airport or a 13-mile trip to John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nAddress 330 East 38th Street New York, NY 10016    ","title":"luxury New York City vacation rental affords views of Central Park","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sbw/d/luxury-new-york-city-vacation/6584677244.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nI am a working girl looking for a small studio/apartment to rent for $600 to $1,200 per month.

I need some days to sort things out and I absolutely do not wish to sleep on the street or in a homeless shelter. Just the thought alone frightens me. I have a job (I work from the computer) and enough money for food handy to make it through the week. All I need is a place where I can lay down my head and where I'm not exposed to danger. I have no direct family or friends who could help me. I want to go back to Europe as soon as possible. Who is willing to help? Even suggestions would help me out a lot. I am not a local and therefore I don't know what I could possibly do. I visited the embassy and applied for an emergency passport. I've found a church who is willing to receive mail and therefore I will have my debit card within a week, and finally acces to my bank account again. I went to hotels and asked for a place to stay, with my passport as a deposit, and a promise I would pay them back upcoming Monday. Unfortunately, which I fully understand, they do not consider this to be an option. I'm looking forward to your ideas/suggestions and many thanks in advance! I ask you kindly, please no sexual or illegal offers. I am a 25 y/o white male. I don't use drugs, I am educated and employed, I don't smoke and I don't drink.\n    ","title":"Stranded European tourist looking for help/suggestions.

As attractive and total package as I am, I'm not looking for a hook-up so more than one roomie will probably be better too. \n\nHere's what will waste your time and mine. I'm not looking to share your bed or live in your basement. It may very well be an awesome space, however, I'm not interested in living in a cave, without light or windows or trees. I'm not looking to go to another site so please no other links. I'm an ethical individual and appreciate other trustworthy folks. I'm not looking to share the costs exactly and you can have a pet but no other pets are welcome. Let's play fair. By the way, I don't have any pets yet I'm pet friendly. I don't smoke either tobacco or cannabis but I'm 420 friendly. I'm not gay and I support the LGBT community. I have no plants yet I love flowers and trees. Go figure. If you think for a moment that no overnight guests are welcome, no thank you. While I rarely drink, don't party or bring the party home, I do value good friends and family and welcome their company. I may on occasion have an out of town guest visit briefly. I do travel often so I probably won't even be around that much. When I am, I promise someone who is considerate, responsible and funny. My references will attest to that. Since I travel often, I'm not interested in renting a whole place by myself but rather a room within a respectful home and a place that I look forward to being a part of.

Not couples. Reason is simple. Why share the bathroom and kitchen with 2 people, when you can share with one? Most 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apts have ONE bathroom! No these apts weren't meant for 3 couples of 6 adults and it's illegal against fire code besides. \n\nCouples feel they're entitled to have a second person to live for free. No for your information, if you are part of a couple, you MIGHT get a room by paying EXTRA for the extra roommate! Novel idea huh?\n\nMost likely, you won't have any luck getting a couple, \"buy one, get one free\" room. Your best bet is looking for a studio. Or looking in a much less desirable hard to fill area.\n\nOk a studio can run you $1350-$1500/mo in Queens. Much less in Staten Island, about $1000 (but you might need a car). Less in the Bronx, maybe a studio for about $1100? Cost more in Brooklyn. Manhattan studios start at $2000, so I guess you can't walk to work! You must pay first, last months security and one months brokers fee. Nothing in your budget is \"walkable\" or \"30 minute commute\".  or 2 blocks to the subway! Try an hour. Don't know about the interns that want a place for a few months. Probably they can just stay home.\n\nOr move to NJ. Look in Newport, it's near a Mall.\n\nLast week I saw an ad for 3 adults and 2 dogs who want to squeeze into ONE ROOM to save for an apt! Uh NO! That's against the fire codes and cause for eviction!

Yikes, for 20 somethings you certainly aren't internet savvy!\n\nIf you can't afford the rents here, Do NOT come here. Anyone who is looking for a roommate cannot afford to do you a favor. No one is willing to pay 75% of the rent, so you can pay 25%. Grow up!\n\nTry to be realistic about the apt. No millionaire is renting out rooms. There is no private extra bathroom. Yes you might have to walk up. A private entrance is called a studio apt. And no one has \"extra\" rooms. You're lucky to get ANYTHING! Demand exceeds supply!\n\nAnd yes you will have to take the subway. Count on a one hour commute average. Each way.

Landlords are not looking on Craiglist for \"cheap\" renters to fill their apts! There are 10 people in a day who want to rent an apt!\n\nIf you want an apt in NYC you really must go to a broker. Sometimes they will have no-fee apts. Unless you know someone who has a vacancy in their building, then this is the way it is done. You might get lucky and find one in a million on the internet, but more likely you will be sleeping on the subway. You will mostly have no luck posting on here and begging for a no broker \"cheap\" apt. It's a crapshoot. Is that what you want?\n\nNo I don't work for a real estate company. but plenty of times I have rented out my apt and I put up an ad on CL getting TONS of replies in one day. Landlords can pick and choose. There are no \"cheap\" or \"reasonable\" apts.\n\nMuch more sensible to get your own apt and then advertise for your own roommate. Yeah, obviously it's cheaper to have your roommate pay all the fees and furnish the place too. Then you want 2 people to split the room!!! Why would anyone take 2 people to share the bathroom and kitchen when they can have one? Some posters even want 4 people to squeeze into a room while they save for an apt!!! Or 3 adults and 2 huge dogs for $200/mo!!! This is illegal and against FDNY laws. This is cause for eviction.\n\nYou really have to research what apts are going for and divide that by the amount of bedrooms. Finances are all math. If you are listing a BELOW MARKET price for \"room wanted\" don't be shocked if you get no real responses. Fingers crossed won't do it. I have time to write educational posts, but MOST PEOPLE ARE WAY TOO BUSY TO STRAIGHTEN YOU OUT. And by the way, in Manhattan space is very expensive. No one has extra empty rooms that they can rent out for a lowball price. Millionaires are not looking for roommates.\n\nYesterday someone wants to rent a room for 7 cats! Huh?

I don't require much space. Im 420 friendly but I can keep it out of your home. Im a non smoker. Im 47 and Im willing to trade cleaning /pet grooming/childcare services for place to live. I have managed to maintain one client while homeless so I am not wholly unemployed but I could use a break on the first month rent. In exchange you get a rational, very chill, connected roommate/tenent who can most likely make up for the first month rent after getting back on my feet. Im tired of using my computer for a pillow and filching complimentary coffee from hotel lobbies. I have a lot going for me and with your help I can make that snowball. Please extend an olive branch. I m worth the investment of time and money. Thank you so much for reading this. So far I have managed not to appear or smell homeless ...

I am an older female, not a kid. I have one pet, an older well behaved cat. I have a strong managerial, sales, and office background. I have also taken care of children and done a lot of elder care. I would like to work a certain # of hours in exchange for housing doing office or graphics work. (Anything above that I will likely also gladly work if we can agree on a set rate of pay, situation, etc.) I can also sit kids or animals, have done both, though the kids it's been a very long time. I do have a friend and ex-manager who can vouch for me. I am extremely responsible and trustworthy. Yes, this is a real person asking, not some kind of CL flake thing. \n\nCan you help? Hook me up with decent situation? Do you need help? Lately my charges have had dentures. I'm kind of ready for fun and games, museums, playing in the parks and stuff like that. I miss that. I did have CPR back then but I would have to recertify now. I've also done cooking for older folks a lot. I'm a good cook or so I am told. I can cook just about any cuisine there is usually. I don't want to be a f/t housekeeper. I'm going to say that up front but I'm very open to a lot of things otherwise so long as it is legit. \n\nI am looking for a LEGITIMATE barter/work position. Not a FWB thing. I am being polite. Generally speaking I always answer emails and am very professional about it, but I am not here to be abused and I won't answer any emails about a situation like that. \nI am looking for something long term and stable. I'm trying very hard to stay in the city, at least within a decent subway ride of Manhattan. I don't need to live right in it but I do like to go in and do photography, museums when I am off. I would prefer a live in but living out might be possible if I can get a room in the area that I can afford. In that case I would definitely expect a regular salary. I'm looking for a job with a place to live but it's not 100% non-negotiable that it not be live out. \n\nTY    ","title":"Mature Female Seeks Barter Situation","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sha/d/mature-female-seeks-barter/6588769778.html"},{"body":"\n        \n            QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nLooking for roommates to join a 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom apartment lease at UWS.

The way to do this is to find a job where you live and save up money to move.\n\nMany young people here think someone in NYC can host them for free, for a few months, while they look for a job? No. No one can afford that. This is a roommate or rental site. People who have a room need to charge MARKET RATE, because their landlord is charging THEM market rate.\n\nSo if you have a dream to move to NYC that's great. Save your money and move here. Sure some people can move here in college, they have rich parents and can prove it with bank statements. It's expensive to live here. Don't expect to move here with no money.\n\nPLEASE, PLEASE do not come here to go to private college and take out enormous student loans for tuition and rent in Manhattan! If you DO decide to go to school here, NO ONE has to live a 5 minute walk to school. You DON'T have to live in the Village, Upper East Side or Upper West Side. Make do with a Metrocard and commute from Queens or whatever borough. This student loan debt to pay Manhattan rent is SICK.\n\nIf you are looking to \"barter\" for no money, please list your ad under \"barters\". Not this section.

I am a working single guy who is looking for a place to call home.\n\nI'm looking for an unfurnished bedroom, at least 120 square feet in size, to rent in northern Brooklyn for a long-term lease and am willing to pay $600 to $800 a month.\nI'm a quiet, clean, responsible, and respectful young man in my late 20s. My income is 33K a year, my credit score is 633, and I work 45 hours a week as a private security officer. I'm a non-smoker and I have no children and no pets. Also, I'm looking to move in no sooner than June 1st. It will give me time to save up money for first month's rent but I can pay the security deposit now.\n\nI know what I'm looking for is damn near impossible but if you are a landlord reading this and you do have such a place, please reach out and contact me.
